</div>

<p>In order to safeguard the reputation of that
worthy seaman and most gallant gentleman who
writes this memoir, the editor thereof deems it
proper to call attention to the fact that Master
Hampdon has described accurately the Island
of Mangaia of the Cook, or Hervey, group in the
South Seas. It is still completely encircled by
the unbroken barrier reef, over which the natives
ride in their light canoes. The stairs still exist
despite the earthquake to which Master Hampdon
refers—and other upheavals which may
have followed—and are still traversed by the
feet of curious, if infrequent, visitors. For the
rest, such altars and platforms as he and his little
lady found still abound in the South Seas. Also
on Easter Island, and on others, too, such statues
of the grotesque and hideous “Stone Goddes” as
he describes may be seen. Who made them and
why, as well as when they were put there, are as
much mysteries today as they were when, in that
far-off time, Master Hampdon and his lady
sailed those then unknown seas in that brave little
barque <i>The Rose of Devon</i>.</p>

<span class="small">WHEREIN I BAIT THE LIVING OVER THE DEAD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;CANNOT say that I was greatly surprised
when I stumbled across the body of Sir
Geoffrey in the spinney, which is not for a moment
meant to convey the impression that I was
not shocked. Many times before that morning
in my long and adventurous life I had, as I have
often since, seen many people die in all sorts of
sudden and dreadful ways, in all parts of the
globe, too. And in some cases where the sufferer
was past hope and the suffering great, I
have prayed for the good mercy of a quick end;
but never, even under such circumstances, have
I been able to look upon death philosophically,
at least afterwards. The shock is always there.
It always will be, I imagine; indeed I would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
have it otherwise. I hope never to be indifferent
to the passing of that strange mysterious
thing we call life. But I digress.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I had expected that Sir Geoffrey
would come to some such sad end, therefore,
I repeat that I was not surprised; but as I
stood over him in the gray dawn, looking down
upon him lying so quietly on his back with the
handsome, silver-mounted, ivory-handled dueling
pistol, with which he had killed himself,
still clasped in his right hand, I was fascinated
with horror. I was younger then and not so
accustomed to sudden death as I have become
since so many years and so much hard service
have passed over my head.</p>

<p>And this was in a large measure a personal
loss. At least I felt it so for Mistress Lucy’s
sake, and for my own, too. Sir Geoffrey had
been my ideal of the fine gentleman of his time.
I liked him much. He had often honored me
with notice and generally spoke me fair and
pleasantly.</p>

<p>In his situation some men would have blown
out their brains—and there would have been a
singular appositeness in the action in his case—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Sir Geoffrey had carefully put his bullet
through his heart. It was less disfiguring and
brutal, less hard on those left behind, less
troublesome, more gentlemanly! I divined that
was his thought. He was ever considerate in
small matters.</p>

<p>The red stain that had welled over the fine
ruffled linen, otherwise spotless, of his shirt and
the powder marks and burns still visible thereon
in spite of the dried blood, all indicated clearly
what had happened. The pistol was a short
one, heavy in build, made for close work, else he
could never have used it so effectively. For the
rest, he was clad in his richest and best apparel.
His sword lay underneath him, the diamond-studded
hilt protruding. He must have fallen
lightly, gently, I thought, because his body lay
easily on its back and his dress was not greatly
disturbed.</p>

<p>I guessed that he was glad enough, after all,
that the end had come, for his countenance had
not that look of pain, or horror, or fear upon it,
which I have so often seen on the face of the
dead. His features were calm and composed.
Evidently he had not been dead long. I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the first thing I did was to reach down and
gently close his eyes. I shall never forget them
to my dying day. They were dreadfully staring.
As I bent over him for this purpose I
noticed that he had something in his left hand.
That hand was resting lightly by the hilt of his
sword as if he had stood with his left hand
on his sword in that gallant defiant position
which I had often enough seen him assume,
when he pressed the trigger with his right hand.
As he had fallen, his hand had been lifted a
little away from the sword and in his fingers
there was a paper. A nearer look showed it
to be an envelope. I drew it away and, glancing
at it, saw that it was addressed to Mistress Lucy.
Thrusting it in the pocket of my coat, I rose to
my feet.</p>

<p>At that instant I heard steps and voices.
Now I had nothing on earth to fear from anybody.
The death of Sir Geoffrey was too obviously
a suicide for anyone to accuse me, even if
there had been any reason whatever for bringing
me under suspicion. The letter which I
carried in my pocket addressed to Mistress Lucy
would undoubtedly explain everything there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
was to explain. Something, however, moved
me to seek concealment. I am a sailor, as you
will find out, and act quickly in an emergency
by a sort of instinct. On the sea men have little
time for reflection. The crisis is frequently
upon one with little or no warning, and generally
it must needs be met on the instant and without
deliberation.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey lay on the side of the path which
ran through the spinney and beyond him the
coppice thickened. The path twisted and
turned. From the sound of the footsteps, I
judged that men were coming along it. I instantly
stepped across the body and concealed
myself behind a tree trunk in the leafy foliage
of the undergrowth. I could see without being
seen, and hear as well.</p>

<p>The approaching footsteps might belong to
some of the gamekeepers, to a stray poacher, to
some of the servants of the castle, or to someone
who, like myself, had been abroad in the gray
dawn and had been attracted to the spot by the
sound of the shot, although they approached
over leisurely for that. I was prepared for any
of these things but I did not expect that any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the guests of the castle would make their appearance
at that hour. The footsteps stopped.
Two men, one of whom had been pointed out to
me as Baron Luftdon in the lead followed by
another who was strange to me, suddenly appeared.
A voice which I recognized as the
baron’s at once exclaimed in awe-struck tones:</p>

<p>“By gad, he’s done it!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled the other, whose cold blooded
calmness was in marked contrast with the unwonted
excitement of the first speaker, “I rather
expected it.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty affair,” said the first man.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said the second indifferently,
“it might be worse.”</p>

<p>“Worse for him? Great heavens, man, he’s
dead!”</p>

<p>“Worse for us.”</p>

<p>“What d’ ye mean? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, for instance, he might have shot himself
before we—ah—plucked him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” returned my lord with a rather
askant glance at his companion, for which I
almost respected him for the moment.</p>

<p>The two stepped a little nearer. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
speaker, Lord Luftdon, one of the young bloods
who had been having high carouse with Sir
Geoffrey for the past week at the castle, bent
over him.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about his being dead, I
suppose?” he asked after a brief inspection.</p>

<p>“Good gad, no,” replied the second man with
a contemptuous laugh. “Where are your wits,
man? He must have held the muzzle of the
pistol close to his breast. See how his shirt is
burned and powder blackened. He must have
died instantly.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the drawler nonchalantly—as
for me I hated them both but the latter
speaker the more if possible, for reasons which
you will presently understand—“this relieves
me greatly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You are very stupid this morning, <i>mon ami</i>,”
returned the other, gracefully taking a pinch of
snuff and laughing again with that horrible
indifference to the dead man who had been his
host and friend.</p>

<p>“After such a night as we had, to come thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
suddenly upon—this—’tis enough to unsettle any
man,” muttered Luftdon apologetically.</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh! man, you’re nervous.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how it relieves you.
And after all’s said and done, Wilberforce was
a gentleman, a good player and a gallant loser,
and I liked him.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, I liked him too, well enough. And
he lost his all like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“And you got it, at least most of it.”</p>

<p>“Patience, my friend, you had your share, you
know,” returned the other with his damnable
composure.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I’d give it back to have
poor old Geoff with us once again,” retorted
Luftdon with some heat.</p>

<p>“That is a perfectly foolish statement, my
buck,” returned the other, philosophically taking
snuff. “Somebody was bound to get it;
Wilberforce has been going the pace for years;
we happened to be in at the death, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, how does it relieve you, then? Do
you think Wilberforce would have attempted to
get you to support him?”</p>

<p>The drawler laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Of course not, this”—he pointed to the dead
body—“is proof enough of the spirit that was
in him; but of course, I cannot marry the girl
now.”</p>

<p>“You can’t?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Her father a bankrupt and
a suicide—”</p>

<p>“But the castle and this park?”</p>

<p>“Mortgaged up to the hilt. Speaking of
hilts—” he stooped down and daintily avoiding
contact with the corpse, drew from the scabbard
the diamond-hilted sword—“this belongs to me.
It’s worth taking. You remember he staked it
last night on the last deal.”</p>

<p>“Good God, man,” protested the first speaker,
“don’t take the man’s sword away. Let him lie
with his weapons like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, you grow scrupulous, it seems. We
will provide him a cheaper badge of his knighthood,
if necessary,” returned the other lightly.</p>

<p>“And about the girl?”</p>

<p>“’Tis all off.”</p>

<p>“You will have some trouble breaking your
engagement with her, I am thinking.”</p>

<p>“Not I. To do her justice, the wench has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the spirit of her father. A whisper that I am—er—disinclined
to the match will be quite
sufficient.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but who will give her that whisper?”</p>

<p>“We will arrange that some way. Truth to
tell, I am rather tired of the minx, she bores me
with her high airs. She does not know that she
is penniless and disgraced. And as for her good
looks—’tis a country beauty after all.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl—” began Luftdon, whose face,
though bloated and flushed and seamed with the
outward and visible evidences of his evil life,
still showed some signs of human kindness.</p>

<p>At that point I intervened. I could bear no
more. When they spake so slightingly of my
little mistress it was more than I could stand.
I burst out of the brush and stood before them—mad,
enraged all through me. I will admit
that I lacked the composure and breeding of that
precious pair. What I had heard had filled me
with as hot an indignation as ever possessed the
soul of man, and with every moment the fire of
my resentment burned higher and more furiously.
They started back at my sudden appearance,
in some little discomfiture, from which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of the slower speech the more speedily recovered.
He was the greater man, and eke the
greater villain. The younger, the one with the
red face, looked some of the discomposure he
felt. The other presently leered at me in a deliberate
and well intentioned insulting way and
began:</p>

<p>“Now who may you be, my man, and what
may you want?”</p>

<p>“Who I may be matters nothing,” said I, “but
what I want matters a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Ah! And what is it that you want that matters
so much?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, that sword.”</p>

<p>“This?” asked the sneering man, holding Sir
Geoffrey’s handsome weapon lightly by the
blade and smiling contemptuously at me.</p>

<p>“That,” answered I with equal scorn.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to move quickly as well as
to think quickly, and before he knew it, I had
it by the hilt and but that he released the blade
instantly I would have cut his hand as I withdrew
it. He swung round and clapped his hand
on his own sword, a fierce oath breaking from
his lips, his face black as a thundercloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Don’t draw that little spit of yours,” I said,
“or I will be under the necessity of breaking
your back.”</p>

<p>I towered above both of them and I have no
doubt that I could have made good my boast.
Yet, to do him justice, the man had the courage
of his race and station. He faced me undaunted,
his hand on his sword hilt.</p>

<p>“Would you rob me of mine own, Sirrah?”
he asked more calmly if not less irritatingly.</p>

<p>“I might do so, and with justice,” I replied.
“You had no hesitation in robbing the living or
the dead.”</p>

<p>“Zounds!” cried the other man, touched on
the raw of a guilty conscience apparently, “’twas
in fair play. We risked each what we had and
Sir Geoffrey lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” I replied. “Having paid you
with everything else, and possessing nothing
beside, he had to throw away his life in the end.
I heard what you said. You wonder how Mistress
Wilberforce is to learn the situation—you
who have doubtless once borne the reputation of
a man of honor! You wonder who is to tell her
that you discard her. I will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“That is good, well thought of, yokel,” said
the drawler with amazing assurance, and keeping
his temper in a way that increased mine, “I
could not have wished it better. As for your
reflections upon me they interest me not at all.
You are doubtless some servant of the house—”</p>

<p>“I am no man’s servant,” I interrupted in some
heat.</p>

<p>“Somebody born on the place who probably
cherishes a peasant’s humble admiration for the
lady of the manor,” he continued.</p>

<p>I displayed the red ensign in my weather-beaten
cheeks at this. I never was good at the
dissimulation that goes on in polite society and
I never could control my color for all I am
bronzed with the wind and spray of all the seas,
to say nothing of tropic suns.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he laughed sneeringly, taking keen
note of my confusion, “see the red banner of
confession in the brute’s face, Lord Luftdon.”</p>

<p>“I see it, of course,” said the other, whose
frowning face was far redder than my own,
though from drink—“but I must confess that
personally I don’t like the allusion.”</p>

<p>“That for your likes, Luftdon,” cried the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
as contemptuous of his companion as of me apparently.
“Tell her, my man, tell her. Tell
her that she is a beggar and her father a suicide,
and that I have all her property without her.
She can go to your arms or those of any other
she fancies. She is not meet for the Duke of
Arcester.”</p>

<p>So this was Arcester! I had heard of him,
as I had of Luftdon, two of the most debauched,
unprincipled rakes, idlers, fortune hunters,
gamblers, men-about-town, in all England. But
of the two he bore much the worse reputation.
Indeed, no one in that day surpassed him in baseness
and villainy. But that he was a duke, he
had been branded, jailed, or even hanged long
since in England. But I cared nothing for his
dukedom. As he spoke thus slightingly of my
lady, I stepped closer to him and struck him with
the palm of my hand. I suppose a gentleman
would have tapped him lightly but not being of
that degree I struck hard across the face, not
so hard as I might have, to be sure, for I could
doubtless have killed him, but hard enough to
make him reel and stagger. His sword was out
on the moment but before he could make a pass I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
wrenched it from him, broke the blade over my
knee and hurled the two pieces into the coppice.</p>

<p>“I can match you with swords,” said I, coolly
enough now that the issue was made and the
battle about to be joined. “I have fought with
men, not popinjays, in my day, all over the world,
and I know the use of the weapon; but I would
not demean myself, being an honest man though
no gentleman, much less a duke, by crossing
blades with such a ruffian.”</p>

<p>“By God!” cried the duke furiously, “I will
have you flogged and flung into the mill pond, I
will clap you in jail, I will—”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the sort,” said I, composedly.
“There is no man on the estate who
would not take my part against you, especially
when I repeat what you have said about Mistress
Lucy. They love her and they loved him.
With all his drink and extravagance he was a
good master and you have been a bad friend.”</p>

<p>“And who would believe you?” queried the
duke, whose anger was at a frightful height in
being thus braved and insulted. In his agitation
he tore at his neckcloth and almost frothed
at the mouth like a man in a fit—I doubt he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
ever been so spoken to before. “’Twould be
your word against mine, you dog, and—”</p>

<p>“For the matter of that, my word will not be
uncorroborated,” I interrupted swiftly.</p>

<p>“What d’ ye mean, curse you?”</p>

<p>“This gentleman—”</p>

<p>“By gad,” said Lord Luftdon, decisively, responding
to my appeal more bravely than I had
thought, “you are right to appeal to me and you
were right to strike Arcester. ’Fore God, I’m
sorry for the girl and for Sir Geoffrey and
ashamed for my—my—friend.”</p>

<p>“Would you turn against me in this?” asked
the duke, surprised at this amazing defection.</p>

<p>“I certainly would,” answered the other with
dogged courage.</p>

<p>“God!” whispered his grace hotly, fumbling
at the empty sheath, “I wish I had my sword.
I’d run the two of you through!”</p>

<p>“There is Sir Geoffrey’s sword,” said Lord
Luftdon, who did not lack courage, it seemed,
clutching his own blade as he spoke and making
as if to draw it.</p>

<p>“No,” said I, master of the situation as I
meant to be, “there shall be no more fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
over the dead body of Sir Geoffrey. You and
Lord Luftdon can settle your differences elsewhere.
I am glad for his promise to tell the
truth in case you attempt to carry out your
threat and I am just as grateful as if it had been
necessary.”</p>

<p>“On second thought, there will be no further
settlement,” said Luftdon, regaining his coolness
and thrusting back into its scabbard his half-drawn
blade. “His grace and I are in too many
things to make a permanent difference between
us possible.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” I replied.</p>

<p>“By gad,” laughed Luftdon, “I like your
spirit, lad. Who are you, what are you?”</p>

<p>“The late gardener’s son.”</p>

<p>“Do they breed such as you down here in these
gardens?”</p>

<p>“As to that, I know not, my lord. I am a
sailor. I have commanded my own ship and
made my own fortune. I come back here between
cruises because I am devoted to—”</p>

<p>“The woman!” sneered the duke, and I marveled
at the temerity of the man, seeing that I
could have choked him to death with one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Mention her name again,” I cried, “and you
will lie beside your victim yonder!”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Luftdon approvingly.</p>

<p>“I come back here because I am fond of the
old place. Lord Luftdon, it is my home. My
people have served the Wilberforces for generations.
Their forebears and mine lie together
in the churchyard around the hill yonder.
You can’t understand devotion like that,” said I,
turning to the duke, “and ’tis not necessary
that you should.”</p>

<p>“And indeed what is necessary for me, pray?”
he sneered.</p>

<p>“That you and Lord Luftdon leave the place
at once.”</p>

<p>“Without speech with my lady?”</p>

<p>“Without speech with anyone. There is a
good inn at the village. I will take it upon myself
to see that your servants pack your mails
and follow you there at once.”</p>

<p>“I will not be ordered about like this,” protested
the duke blusteringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you will,” said Luftdon. “The advice
he gives is good. We have nothing more
to do here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“No,” said I bitterly, “you have done about
all that you can. The man is dead but the
woman’s heart will not be broke because of you.
Now go.”</p>

<p>“If I had a weapon,” said Arcester slowly,
shooting at me a baleful and envenomed glance,
“I believe I would even send one of his faithful
retainers to accompany Sir Geoffrey.”</p>

<p>I never saw a man who was more furiously
angry, baffled, humiliated than he. As for me,
I was glad of his rage. If I had known any
way to make him more angry and humiliated I
confess I would have followed it.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Arcester,” said the other;
“you’ve got everything you wanted in this game
and ’tis only just that you should pay a little for
it. What’s your name, my man?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what it is.”</p>

<p>“Are you ashamed of it?”</p>

<p>“Hampdon!”</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon, you may not be a gentleman,”
said Luftdon, “but by gad, you are a man,
and here’s my hand on ’t.”</p>

<p>He had played a man’s part, so I clasped it.</p>

<p>“You will be embracing him next, inviting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
him to your club, I suppose,” said Arcester in
mocking contempt.</p>

<p>“No,” said Luftdon, sarcastically, “he would
not be congenial company for you and me,
neither would we be for him. He seems to be
an honest man. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>And so they went down the path, leaving me
not greatly relishing my triumph, for now I had
to tell Mistress Lucy all that had happened. I
had to say the words that would tell of the loss
in one fell moment of her father, of her property,
and of her lover. I was greatly puzzled
what to say and how to say it, for Mistress Lucy
Wilberforce was no easy person to deal with
at best.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="small">WHICH SHOWS HOW I BROKE THE NEWS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE path from the spinney to the ancient
castle which antedated King Henry
VIII, and which in its older parts goes much
farther back into the past, led through the park
full of noble oaks and beeches, many of them
older even than the ancient and honorable family
which now, alas, bade fair to lose them all
forever. As I trudged over it with lagging footsteps,
misliking my duty more and more as the
necessity for discharging it drew closer, I caught
a glint of rapidly moving color on the long driveway
that led from the lodge to the steps of the
hall. The scarlet of my lady’s riding coat as
she galloped up the tree bordered road, it was
that attracted my attention. I quickened my
pace and we arrived at the steps leading up to
the terrace at the same instant. She was alone,
for she had either chosen to ride unaccompanied,
as was her frequent custom, or else, being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
better mounted, she had left her groom far
behind.</p>

<p>I stood silent before her with that curious
dumbness I generally experience—even at this
day—when first entering her presence, while she
drew rein sharply. She was a little thing compared
to me, small compared even to the average
woman, but in one sense she was the biggest
thing I had ever confronted. No burly shipmaster
had ever impressed me so, not even when
I was a raw boy on my first cruise. I actually
looked upon her with a feeling of—well, shall I
say awe?—mingled with other emotions which I
would not have breathed to a soul. The chance
hit by the Duke of Arcester had brought the
color to my cheek and it takes something definite
and apposite to bring the color to a bronzed,
weather-beaten cheek like mine, which has been
thrust into the face of wintry seas and exposed
to tropical suns all over the globe. That is the
way I thought of her. I was almost afraid of
her! I, who feared nothing else on land or sea!
What she thought of me was of little moment to
her.</p>

<p>It was Mistress Lucy’s regular habit to take a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
morning gallop every day. It was that usual
custom that caused her to look so fresh and
young and beautiful, that put the color in her
cheek and the sparkle in her eye. Although she
had left her father playing hard late the night
before when she had gone to bed, there had been
nothing in that to cause her to intermit her practice.
Poor girl, she had left her father doing
that more nights than she could remember in
her short life, and I suppose she had become used
to it, to a certain extent, at any rate.</p>

<p>She nodded carelessly, yet kindly to me. It
was her habit, that careless kindness. When she
was a little girl and I had been a great boy we
had played together familiarly enough—children
caring little for distinctions of rank, I have
observed—but that habit was long since abandoned.
Then she looked about for her groom.
The steps that led to the terrace were deserted.
Sir Geoffrey of late had grown slack in the administration
of affairs on account of his troubles,
therefore no attendant was at hand. Like master,
like man! I suspected that the servants had
kept late hours, too. Indeed they probably
plundered Sir Geoffrey in every way and he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
seeing that all was gone or going, perhaps shut
his eyes to their peculations. They might as
well get what was left as his creditors. Mistress
Lucy after that first nod stared at me
frowning.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she said at last, “since nobody
else seems to be about, suppose you attempt
the task.”</p>

<p>She loosed her little foot from the stirrup and
thrust it out toward me. I am nothing of a
horseman. I was very early sent off to sea and
I have a sailor’s awkwardness with horses.
Naturally I did not know how a lady should
be dismounted from her horse. I had never
attempted the thing and I did not recall ever
to have seen it done, otherwise I might have
managed, for I am quick enough at mechanical
things; but her desire was obvious and I must
accomplish it the best I could. I stepped over
to her, disregarding her outthrust foot, for all
its prettiness, seized her about the waist with
both hands, lifted her bodily from the saddle
and set her down gently on the gravel. She
looked at me very queerly and gave a faint
shriek when her weight came upon my arms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Indeed, I have no doubt that I held her tightly
enough through the air.</p>

<p>“I dare say there is not a man among my
father’s friends or mine, who could have done
that, Master Hampdon,” said she, smiling up at
me a little and looking flushed and excited.</p>

<p>“’Tis no great feat,” said I stupidly enough,
“I have lifted bigger—”</p>

<p>“Women!” flashed out Mistress Lucy slightly
frowning.</p>

<p>“Things,” I replied.</p>

<p>“It amazes me,” she said. “I have never been
dismounted that way before. However, I remember
you always were stronger than most
men, even as a boy. There seem to be no grooms
about, the place is wretchedly served. Will you
take my horse to the stables?” she asked me.</p>

<p>There was a certain flattery to me in that request.
If I had not shown her how strong I
was, in all probability she would have thrown
me the bridle and with a nod toward the stables
to indicate her wishes would have left me without
a word. Now it was different. I took the
bridle, not intending, however, to take the horse
around, not because I disdained to do her any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
service but because I had other duties to discharge
more important than the care of horses.</p>

<p>“Have you seen my father this morning?” she
asked as I paused before her and then, not giving
me time to answer, looked up at the sun. “But
of course not,” she continued, a little bitterly,
“he probably only went to bed an hour or two
since and ’tis not his habit to rise so early as you
and I.”</p>

<p>As luck would have it, while she spoke a
sleepy groom chanced to come round the house.
I flung the reins to him, bade him take the horse
away and turned to my lady.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, my voice thickening and
choking, “as it happens, I have seen your noble
father this morning.”</p>

<p>There was something in my voice and manner,
great stupid fool that I was, that instantly
apprised her that something was wrong. With
one swift step she was by my side.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the spinney.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“But just now.”</p>

<p>“What does he there at this hour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Sir Geoffrey—” I began racking my brains,
utterly at loss what to say next and how to convey
the awful tidings.</p>

<p>She made a sudden step or two in my direction,
then turned toward the coppice, her
suspicions fully aroused.</p>

<p>But now I ventured upon a familiarity, that
is, I turned with her and caught her by the arm
before she could take a step.</p>

<p>“I will see him myself,” she began resolutely.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I swiftly, “you cannot.”</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she said, “something
dreadful has happened.”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>This was breaking it gently with a vengeance,
but what could I do? She always did twist me
around her little finger and I was always more
or less helpless before her. I admit that. I am
still, for that matter, although she will not have
it so.</p>

<p>“What is it? Is my father—what is he doing
in the spinney? He never rises at this hour.”</p>

<p>“Mistress Wilberforce,” I said, “you come of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
a brave stock and the time for your courage is
now.”</p>

<p>“Is my father dead?” she asked, after a sudden,
awful stillness.</p>

<p>I nodded while she stared at me like one
possessed.</p>

<p>“Killed in a duel?” she whispered.
I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Would to God I could think so,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You mean that he was—murdered?”</p>

<p>“Mistress,” said I bluntly, seeing no other
way, “he died by his own hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” she cried, clapping her hands
to her face and reeling back.</p>

<p>I caught her about the waist. She had no
knowledge that she was held or supported, of
course; all her interest and attention were elsewhere.
She did not weep or give way otherwise.
She was a marvelous woman and her
self-mastery and control amazed me, for I knew
how she had loved her father.</p>

<p>“When? Why?” she gasped out.</p>

<p>“I was early awake and abroad,” I answered—and
I did not tell her it was my habit to see her
gallop off for that morning ride, for even a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
glimpse of her was worth much to me—“and I
heard a shot in the spinney. I hurried there and
found Sir Geoffrey—”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Stone dead, mistress, with a bullet in his
heart.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, and I marveled to find myself
assuming the direction as if I had been on the
deck of my own ship, “that you cannot. It is
no sight for your eyes now. I was coming to
the castle to tell you and to send the servants to
fetch—him. Meanwhile, do you go into the
hall and summon your women and—”</p>

<p>“I will do what you say, Master Hampdon,”
she whispered, very small, very forlorn, very
despairing. “My father, oh, my good, kind
father!”</p>

<p>She turned, and I still supporting her, we
mounted the steps of the terrace. Suddenly she
stopped, freed herself, and faced me.</p>

<p>“Lord Luftdon and the Duke of Arcester,”
she explained, “they are staying at the castle;
they must be notified.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, “they already know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“And why then have they left the duty of telling
me to you? Where are they? Summon
them at once.”</p>

<p>“They are gone,” I blurted out, all my rage
at the duke reviving on the instant.</p>

<p>“Gone!”</p>

<p>“Having won everything from Sir Geoffrey
they have left him alone in his death,” I retorted
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“I ordered them off the place,” I said bluntly.</p>

<p>“You!” she flashed out imperiously. “And
who gave you the power to dismiss my—my
father’s friends?”</p>

<p>“I heard what they said, being close hid myself
in the coppice.”</p>

<p>“And what said they?”</p>

<p>“It concerned you, mistress.”</p>

<p>“The Duke of Arcester,” she promptly began,
“is my betrothed husband. I will hear no
calumny against him.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said, keenly aware that I had
made no charges yet and wondering at her
thought, “your engagement is broken.”</p>

<p>“Broken!” she cried in amaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“The duke declared himself to his friend to
be too poor to marry the penniless child of a—disgraced
man—his words, not mine, believe
me.”</p>

<p>The awful death of her beloved father had
been shock enough to her, but with this insult
added I thought she would have swooned dead
away. She turned so white and reeled so that I
caught her again. I even shook her while I
cried roughly,</p>

<p>“You must not give way.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie, a dastardly lie!” she panted out at
last.</p>

<p>“It is God’s truth,” said I. “He repudiates
you.”</p>

<p>“No man could be so base,” she persisted, “he
swore that he loved me.”</p>

<p>“I would it were otherwise, madam, but he is
gone, leaving that message for you.”</p>

<p>“And he made you his messenger?”</p>

<p>“I volunteered.”</p>

<p>“Why? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he is a low coward.”</p>

<p>“And you stood by and let him insult me, your
patron’s daughter, your mistress?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Now so far as that went, I had got mightily
little out of the late Sir Geoffrey’s patronage, but
whatever duty I could compass I would gladly
pay the little lady who stood before me.</p>

<p>“Mistress, you misjudge me. He had taken
Sir Geoffrey’s sword, saying that he had won it
with everything else. I took it from him.
When he said those words about you I struck
him across the face, no light blow, I assure you.
When he grasped his own sword I wrenched it
away from him, broke it, and cast it away. You
may find the broken pieces in the spinney. I
told him that you were meet for his betters and
that you were well rid of him, and bade him
begone.”</p>

<p>“In that,” she said in a certain strained way,
“you acted as a loyal servitor of the house and
I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I am to give orders to have his baggage sent
to the inn at once,” said I.</p>

<p>“And Lord Luftdon?”</p>

<p>“He came to your defense as if he were still
the gentleman he had once been. But he goes
hence with his friend. His baggage will also
follow him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I will attend to that for them both,” said
Mistress Lucy, growing strangely and firmly resolved
again, and even I could guess the tremendous
constraint she put upon herself.
“Enough of Arcester. I am well rid of him
and of his companion. Summon the servants
to bring my father’s body to the castle. I suppose
the crowner will have to be notified.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I. “I will see to that myself.”</p>

<p>“Of all my friends,” said she piteously, almost
giving way, “you seem to be the only one left
me, Master Hampdon.”</p>

<p>“I have been your faithful servant always,
Mistress Lucy,” I answered as I ushered her
into the hall.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="small">IN WHICH I DELIVER A LETTER</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;DELIVERED my little mistress to her
woman who came at my call, and then I
summoned the steward and butler and told them
what had happened. In a moment all was confusion.
But presently they brought the body of
Sir Geoffrey back to the castle which was no
longer his. As the duke had said, it was mortgaged
to its full value. The unfortunate baronet
had gambled away everything in his possession,
the family jewels, the heirlooms of his
daughter, and even the property that had been
left to her by her dead mother, of which he was
trustee. Everything that he could get his hands
on had been sacrificed to his passion for play.</p>

<p>Following the inquest, and after a due interval
to show a decent respect for the dead, there
was a great funeral, of course, during which
what little ready money there was available was
of necessity spent. The gentry came for miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
around, even Luftdon was there in the background,
although Arcester had the decency to
keep away. I was there, too, finding my place
among the upper servants of the household.
Although I was in no sense a servant of the
house, being a free and independent sailorman
and my own master, still I found no place else
to stand. I was glad that I had taken that position
for I happened to be immediately back of
Mistress Lucy. From under her veil she shot
a forlorn, grateful look at me as she came in, as
if she felt I was the only real friend she had in
that great assemblage of the gentry of the
county and the tenants and dependents of the
estate.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey, except Mistress Lucy, was the
last of his race. The brave, fine old stock had
at last been reduced to this one slender slip of
a girl. Kith or kin, save of the most distant,
she had none. Nor did she enjoy a wide acquaintance.
She had never been formally introduced
to society. Sir Geoffrey had loved her
and had been kind enough to her in his careless,
magnificent way, but she had been left much
alone since the death of her mother some years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
before, and she had grown up under the care
of a succession of wandering and ill-paid governesses
and tutors. The neighboring gentry
had assembled for the funeral with much show
of sympathy but in my heart I knew that
Mistress Lucy felt very much alone and I rather
gloried in the position which made me, humble
though I was, her friend. Well, she could
count upon me to the death, I proudly said to
myself. She would find I was always devoted
to her and I solemnly consecrated myself
anew to her service in her loneliness and bereavement.</p>

<p>The show and parade were over soon enough.
The parson’s final words of committal were said.
We left Sir Geoffrey in his place in the churchyard
and went back to the hall, after which the
company began to disperse. I had nothing to
do at the time. No one paid any attention to
me. I held myself above the servants and the
gentry held themselves above me. I wandered
into the hall and stood waiting. No one spoke
to me save Lord Luftdon, who expressed a
heart-felt regret that he had had anything to do
with the final plundering of the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
baronet, which in a measure had brought about
this sorry ending to his career.</p>

<p>“You seem to be a man of sense, Master
Hampdon,” he whispered, drawing me apart,
after it was all over, “and I noticed the way Mistress
Wilberforce looked at you when she first
came in.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked hotly, not liking
to hear her name on his lips, and especially
resenting what I thought was a reflection upon
her.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the best,” he answered equably.
“I have still unspent some of the proceeds of our
last bout at the table with her father that could
be conveyed to the lady, and—”</p>

<p>“She would burn her hand off rather than accept
anything,” said I promptly.</p>

<p>“But, man, I wish to—” he persisted.</p>

<p>“It is not to be thought of.”</p>

<p>“You speak with authority?” he asked, looking
at me strangely.</p>

<p>“I have known her from a child,” said I, “and
her father before her. It is not in the breed to
take favors, and—”</p>

<p>“But this is—er—restitution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Did you win it fairly?” I asked.</p>

<p>“By God,” he answered, clapping his hand to
his sword, “if another had asked me that I would
have had him out.”</p>

<p>“Your answer?” I persisted, undaunted by his
fierceness.</p>

<p>He smiled, his sudden heat dying out apparently
as he realized how foolish it was to quarrel
with me and discovered the meaning of my
question.</p>

<p>“Of course we won it fairly. Sir Geoffrey
was the most reckless and even the most foolish
gambler I ever played with. We took advantage
of that, but there was no cheating, Master
Hampdon, no, on my honor, as I am a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances then,” said I,
“there is nothing further to be said.”</p>

<p>“But what will the poor girl do?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>I shook my head. I did not know how to
answer that question for I did not know what
she would do. Nevertheless I was not a little
touched and pleased with his interest and desire.
Surely the man had some good in him still.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Association with such a scoundrel as Arcester
had not yet wholly ruined him.</p>

<p>“You should have thought of this before,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” he admitted rather
woefully.</p>

<p>“It is too late to make reparation now,
although the wish does you honor, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Well, Hampdon, if you have a chance to tell
her what I wanted,” he said, “please do. I
should do it myself,” he continued, “only since
her repudiation by that blackguard Arcester she
will not admit me to speech. By gad—” he
looked over at her where she stood in the doorway
going through the dreary process of bidding
farewell to the guests after the funeral meal that
had followed the interment, “by gad, if I were
a bit younger and not so confoundedly in debt
I would marry the woman myself.”</p>

<p>“She is meet for a better man, my lord,” said
I, exactly as I had answered the duke.</p>

<p>He looked at me curiously for a moment and
then laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” he said, “you may tell her that,
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>With that he turned on his heel and walked
away and I saw no more of him. I stood idle
on the terrace until the last of the gentry had
gone. As before, I did not know just what to do
or just where to go. My position was most
anomalous. I wanted to be of service, but how
to offer myself without intrusion, I could not
readily discover. It was my lady herself who
solved the problem.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she began wearily, “will
you come into the house? Master Ficklin, the
lawyer, is here, waiting to go over my father’s
papers with me. You have stood by me manfully,
your people and my people have been—”
she stopped a moment, “friends,” she added with
kindly condescension, “for five hundred years.
I have no one else with whom to counsel. Come
with me.”</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey’s will, as Master Ficklin read it,
was a simple affair. It left everything of which
he died possessed to his daughter. Unfortunately,
he died possessed of nothing; the document
was mere waste paper. Everything was
mortgaged, every family portrait, even. Mistress
Lucy appeared to have no legal right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
anything in or out of the castle apparently, save
the clothes she wore.</p>

<p>“Sir Geoffrey,” said Master Ficklin, endeavoring
to put a good face on the matter, “was
well meaning—most well meaning. Not only
did he play high and long at the gaming table
but he speculated also, for he was always trusting
to recoup himself; in which event doubtless there
would have been a handsome patrimony for his
daughter.”</p>

<p>“You may spare me any encomiums of my
father, Master Ficklin,” said Mistress Lucy very
haughtily; “I knew his devotion and affection
better than anyone possibly could.”</p>

<p>In her mind there was no double meaning to
these brave words she uttered so quickly,
although I listened amazed. To rob his daughter
of her all in the indulgence of a wicked
passion for gaming and speculation was no great
evidence of devotion or affection, I thought.
However, Master Ficklin was only putting the
best face upon a sorry matter, and for that I
honored him, for all my mistress’ haughty and
imperious manner.</p>

<p>“The point is, however,” she continued, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Master Ficklin bowed deferentially toward her,
“that I have nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing from your father, madam,” answered
the man of law.</p>

<p>“But my mother’s estate?”</p>

<p>“I regret to say,” said Master Ficklin, “that
most of it has been converted into money and—er—lost
by your father. Strictly speaking he
had no—er—legal right to dispose of your
property and we might recover by suits at law
from those—”</p>

<p>“I gave him the right,” interrupted Mistress
Lucy quickly.</p>

<p>She had never given him any such right, of
course, but she was jealous for the honor of her
father and the family and I could only admire
her action, although the plain, blunt truth ever
appeals to me, let it hurt whom it may.</p>

<p>“In that case, there is nothing to be said or
done,” returned the old attorney, who knew the
facts as well as I.</p>

<p>“I forget,” she went on, “just how much of
my mother’s property was devoted to—to our
needs, by my father and myself.”</p>

<p>“There is left in my hands, madam, a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of some two thousand pounds out at interest
which you, being now of full age—”</p>

<p>“I was eighteen on my last birthday.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, so that the two thousand is at your
present disposal.”</p>

<p>“In what shape is it?”</p>

<p>“It is invested in consols.”</p>

<p>“Can they be realized upon?”</p>

<p>“Instantly.”</p>

<p>“To advantage?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Master Ficklin, for your provident
care of my little fortune. It is most unexpected,”
she faltered, almost overwhelmed at
the sudden realization that she was not altogether
a pauper.</p>

<p>“Believe me, Mistress Lucy, it is a happiness
to do anything for you,” said the old attorney,
rising and gathering up his papers, and bowing
low before her. “My father, and his father
before him served the estates of the Wilberforces,
and for how many generations back I
know not. You may command me in everything.
A temporary loan, or—”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Master Ficklin,” said Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Lucy, “you touch me greatly, but I need
nothing at present. My father made me an
allowance and generally paid it. It was a generous
one; living alone as I did I could not spend
it all. I have a few hundred pounds in my own
name at the bank, and with that for temporary
use and my mother’s legacy I shall lack nothing.”</p>

<p>“But where will you live, Mistress Lucy?”</p>

<p>“It matters little,” she answered listlessly.</p>

<p>“My sister and I,” said the old attorney, “live
alone in the county town. The house is large.
If you would accept our hospitality until your
future is decided we should be vastly honored.”</p>

<p>“Master Ficklin—” began my lady.</p>

<p>“I know that the accommodations are poor,”
interrupted the attorney hastily, “and we are
humble folk, but—”</p>

<p>“I accept your kindly proffer most thankfully,”
was her prompt reply. “I have been
invited to various homes here and there in the
county, but those who invited me have sought
to convey a favor to me by their courtesy and I
prefer to go to you.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Master Ficklin briskly. “That
is settled then. No one has either a legal or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
a moral claim to your clothes or personal belongings
or such jewelry as you have been accustomed
to wear or have in your possession.
You may pack everything of that sort and take
away with you any little keepsake. In fact, I
am empowered by those who held the mortgage
to tell you that the pictures of your father or
mother or anything strictly personal they waive
their claim to.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mistress Lucy, “I shall take
but small advantage of their generosity.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” answered Master Ficklin,
“and now I will return to the town. If you will
be ready about six o’clock—” it was then about
two—“I will return and fetch you to our home.”</p>

<p>“I shall be ready. Good-by.”</p>

<p>The little lawyer bent over her hand and left
the room. I had sat dumb and silent during the
whole interview, although I had listened to
everything with the deepest interest. As usual
it was she who broke the silence when we were
alone again.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she began, “to what a
sorry pass am I reduced! What shall I do
now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“My lady,” said I, “the sorriest part of the
pass to which you have been brought is that you
have in me such a poor counselor, a rough sailor,
but one who would, nevertheless, give his
heart’s blood to promote your welfare, or do
you any service.”</p>

<p>Now as I said that I laid my hand on the
breast of my coat and as I bent awkwardly
enough toward her—I could not even bow as
gracefully as the little attorney just departed—I
felt the paper which I had taken from Sir
Geoffrey’s hand and which I had entirely forgot
in the hurry and confusion of the days that had
followed his death. I stood covered with surprise
and shame at my careless forgetfulness, and
stared at her.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, instantly noting my
amaze.</p>

<p>“I am a fool, madam, a blundering fool,”
said I, drawing forth the paper. “Here is a letter
addressed to you which I should have delivered
at once,” I continued extending it
toward her.</p>

<p>“To me? From whom?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Your father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“My father!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I took it from his dead hand that morning
and thrust it into the breast of my coat and
forgot it until this very moment. It may be
vital to your future, my carelessness may have
lost you—”</p>

<p>“It can lose me nothing,” said the girl with
unwonted gentleness. I looked for her to rate
me sharply, as I deserved, for my forgetfulness,
but she was in another mood. “I can read it
now with more composure and understanding
than before,” she went on.</p>

<p>She tore open the envelope as she spoke and
drew forth a letter, unfolded it, and there
dropped from it a little piece of parchment
which I instantly picked up and extended to
her. But she was so engrossed in the letter that
she did not see my action and paid no attention
to my outstretched hand.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<span class="small">SHOWS HOW TWO PIECES OF PARCHMENT WERE
FITTED TOGETHER</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UNDER the circumstances, therefore, and
without a thought that my action might
be considered a possible violation of confidence,
I looked at the parchment I held in my hand.
It was evidently the half of a larger sheet which
had been torn in two. The right half was in
my possession. A glance showed me that it was
a part of a rudely-drawn map, apparently of an
island, although, lacking the other half, of that I
could not be quite certain. Being a seafaring
man, I was familiar with maps and charts of all
sorts but I must admit that I had never seen a
map that looked exactly like that one. It was
lettered in characters which were very old and
quaint, and some figures in the upper right-hand
corner appeared to indicate a longitude. The
outlines of the map and the letters and figures
were all very dim and faded and a longer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
closer inspection than I could give it then would
be needed to show just what they were.</p>

<p>My lady’s letter was a short one, for she
looked up from it presently, her eyes filled with
tears, the first I had seen there, and for that
reason I was glad she could enjoy this relief.
I suppose the fact that she was so alone and had
no one else induced her to confide in me. At
any rate, she extended the paper to me.</p>

<p>“Read it,” she said. “’Tis my father’s last
word to me.”</p>

<p>I took it from her and this is what I read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>My Dear Lucy</i>:</p>

<p>As an ancient King of France once said, everything is lost
but honor, and that trembles in the balance. I have speculated,
gambled, tempted fortune; first because I loved it and
at last hoping to win for you. But everything has gone
wrong. You are penniless, even your mother’s fortune, of
which she foolishly made me trustee, has followed my own.
Master Ficklin may save something from the wreck. I
hope so. I can do no more and perhaps, nay certainly, the
best thing I can do for you is to leave you. May God help
you since I cannot.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="marginright">Your shamed and unhappy father,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Geoffrey Wilberforce</span>.</p>

<p>Post Scriptum: The last thing that I possess is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
scrap of parchment. It has been handed down from father
to son for five generations. The tradition of it is lost, but
there has always been attached to it a singular value. Perhaps
some day the missing part may turn up. There used
to be a little image with it, but that has disappeared, too.
At any rate, of all that I once had, this alone is left.
Should you marry and have children pass it to them, a foolish
request, but I am moved to make it as my father made
it to me.</p>

<p class="right">G. W.</p>
</div>

<p>I read it slowly. It was not a brave man’s
letter. I liked Sir Geoffrey less then than ever
before. Some of the ancient awe and reverence
I felt for the family went out of my heart then.
Well, the man was dead, and there was no use
dwelling on that any longer. I handed the
letter back to Mistress Lucy without comment.
As she took it I extended the parchment in the
other hand.</p>

<p>“Here,” said I, “is the enclosure to which
your father refers. It seems to be a chart or
map but in its torn condition it is of but little
use.”</p>

<p>She took it listlessly, but as her glance fell
upon it her face brightened.</p>

<p>“Why!” she exclaimed, brushing aside her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
tears, “I, myself, have the other half and also the
image.”</p>

<p>I stared at her stupidly, not in the least taking
in her meaning and she evidently resented my
dullness.</p>

<p>“I have the other half of the parchment, the
missing portion of the map, and the little idol,
I tell you,” she urged.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say—” I began in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she interrupted, “they came to me from
my mother. When she died five years ago she
gave them to me with much the same account
as my father writes. I have never shown them
to anyone, never mentioned the circumstances,
even.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know. The torn map was valueless.
I attached no special importance to the
hideous little image. But now, now—”</p>

<p>“It is a miracle,” I said, “that the two pieces
should have come together in your hands.”</p>

<p>“I don’t yet understand what it all means,”
she said, “but—”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” said I, “may I respectfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
suggest that you get the other piece and the
idol or image and let me look at them? I know
something about such matters.”</p>

<p>“You!” she flashed out in one of those sudden
changes of mood, sometimes so delightful and
sometimes the reverse.</p>

<p>“I am a seafaring man, as you know, Mistress,”
said I humbly, “and I have seen many
strange gods in different parts of the world.
Also I am accustomed to study maps and charts.
Perhaps this may contain information vital to
your fortunes which I can decipher more easily
than another.”</p>

<p>She nodded and went rapidly out of the room.
In a few moments she came back with another
piece of parchment and a little stone figure,
which I glanced at and laid aside for the moment,
fixing my attention on the parchments.
I placed them side by side and the torn and
jagged edges fitted into each other perfectly. I
had laid them on a table and bent over them in
great excitement, excitement on my part caused
by her proximity rather than by the faded,
yellow sheepskin.</p>

<p>“It is an island!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Yes,” said I.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>I pointed with my huge index finger to the
figures in the upper left-hand corner and the
upper right-hand corner marked respectively
latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>“That will tell us exactly.”</p>

<p>“And you can find it?”</p>

<p>“If it be there, where the figures say it is, I
can, as easily as I can find the park gate yonder.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with a certain amount of
awe. Evidently the nice possibilities of the art
of navigation had not been brought to her attention.
I went up several degrees in her respect
it seemed because I knew something she
did not. Well, she was to find out that I knew
many things that she did not—but I must not
boast.</p>

<p>“Why, that is wonderful!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not at all. It is done by seamen every
day.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been there?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “I have crossed the South Seas
several times but I have never chanced upon that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
island or in fact sailed anywhere near that latitude
or longitude.”</p>

<p>“But you know where it is?”</p>

<p>“Exactly, and if I had my great chart of the
South Seas here, I could put my finger upon it
and show it to you.”</p>

<p>“What,” she asked, pointing with her own
dainty finger in her turn, “is that ring around
the island?”</p>

<p>“That will be a coral reef, I take it. They
usually are broken at some point so that ships
can sail within, but here is a complete circle enclosing
the island. There seems to be no entrance
anywhere. ’Tis unusual and most
strange.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the man that drew the map made a
mistake.”</p>

<p>“I think not. The map has been made by a
seafaring man, that is plain.”</p>

<p>“I see, and the island itself is a circle,” she
said, bending to inspect it more closely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “and it is like no island that I
have ever seen, for here be two great rings like
a gigantic wall and a hill or something of the
sort in the middle.” I bent lower over it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
my turn. My eyes are unusually keen and I
saw words written on the outside of the island
proper and between it and the coral reef.
“See,” said I, “the words ‘ye stairs’!”</p>

<p>“Stairs!” exclaimed the girl in amazement,
“did you ever see stairs on such an island?”</p>

<p>“No, I have not. But these may only be some
natural means of ascent.”</p>

<p>“It is most strange and meaningless,” she said.</p>

<p>“Not so, my lady,” I said, “these torn halves of
the map have not been preserved through generations
and handed down from father to son,
or daughter, so carefully unless there be some
meaning attached to them. What do you know
about it? Forgive the presumption of my inquiry,
but in this matter perhaps I can be of
more service to you than I could be in anything
else.”</p>

<p>“You have been a faithful, devoted servitor,
Master Hampdon,” she said, “and I have no
hesitation in telling you all I know. My mother
and father were distantly related, that is they
were descendants in the fifth generation from
two brothers.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said I, “your father’s note says this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
piece of parchment has been in possession of his
family for five generations and evidently the
other was in the possession of your mother’s people
for the same time.”</p>

<p>“Why, that must be so,” said the girl amazed,
“indeed, I think you are very acute to have
reasoned it out.”</p>

<p>“I have but anticipated your own reflections, I
am sure,” said I. “Who was the father of these
two brothers?”</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Sir Philip Wilberforce was his name. He
was—”</p>

<p>“A sailor!” I exclaimed on a venture.</p>

<p>“You have guessed rightly; he voyaged in distant
seas in Queen Elizabeth’s time. It is reported
that he was one of the first who went
around the world after Sir Francis Drake
showed all Englishmen the way.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” I cried, “we are on the right track
now. What further?”</p>

<p>“It is in my mind,” she said, “that Geoffrey
and Oliver, his sons, quarreled over his property
after his death, and—”</p>

<p>“There you have it. They divided his fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and tore the parchment apart, it being
thought valuable for some reason, and each kept
half,” I returned confidently.</p>

<p>“That is the tradition as regards the fortune,
and it may account for the parchment,” she admitted
in admiration of my conclusion, though
indeed it was an easy one to draw.</p>

<p>“What next, madam?”</p>

<p>“The families drifted apart and gradually
died out until Sir Geoffrey and my mother were
alone left of their respective lines, and without
knowing the relationship at the time they met
and married, and I—” she faltered and put her
hand over her face—“am the only one left of
the family, of either branch.”</p>

<p>“Now here,” said I devoutly, for I fully believed
what I said, “are the workings of Divine
Providence. The parchment came from old
Sir Philip, it was torn apart by his sons, and the
pieces came not together until in you the ancient
lines were united.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what does it mean?” she asked turning
to the table again.</p>

<p>As she did so the sleeves of her dress caught
the parchment and separated the two pieces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
One of them fell to the floor face downward.
I picked it up.</p>

<p>“Why, there is writing on it!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“So there is. I had forgotten that. It was
unintelligible to me and, in fact, I put it in my
jewel case and forgot about it.”</p>

<p>“And the image?”</p>

<p>“It was so hideous and so repellent I thrust
it into a drawer of my cabinet and forgot it
too.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put the two pieces together and take
them to the light and see if we cannot decipher
it,” said I. “Mistress Wilberforce,” I continued,
“I have a sailor’s premonition that we
are on the track of something that may greatly
better your fortunes.”</p>

<p>There was no table near the window but I
spread the two pieces of parchment on my two
broad hands, from which you can get an idea
of how large they were. The writing was dim
and faded with age. It seemed to have been
done with some sharp pointed instrument which
cut into the sheepskin, and where the ink which
had been used had faded, the scratches still remained.
This that follows is what I made out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
I have reproduced exactly the old spelling and
capitalization, and for your further illumination
I have copied as best I could the map, or
chart, upon the other side, so you can easily comprehend
the story of our adventures upon it as
I am now endeavoring to relate them. Of
course my memory may be at fault in some particulars,
but if so they are unimportant. As for
the image, I can never forget its grinning,
malign, evil hideousness, no, not to my dying
day.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i060.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>I spelt out the letters slowly, deciphering the
quaint, faint writing with difficulty. Mistress
Lucy drew near to me, bending over the parchment
closely, following my efforts, indeed
anticipating them with her quicker eye. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
presence was a distraction to me, yet I was so
glad to have her near me that I wished the
parchment letter as long as this story I am writing
bids fair to be. Well, we finished it at last.</p>

<p>Then I turned to the table in the center of
the room where I had left the image. I stooped
over it, picked it up and brought it to the light.
It was a head, with the neck and the top of
the shoulders showing, mounted on a pedestal
roughly cut in imitation masonry. It was
made of some hard pinkish stone like granite.
There was no skill or nicety in its carving;
it was rough and rude, inexpressibly so, and the
marks of the chisel, or whatever the tool with
which it had been carved, were quite apparent
here and there; and yet years of exposure to wind
and weather had smoothed it off in part. The
evil face was long and the dog teeth fell over
the protruding lip in a peculiarly brutal and
ferocious way. There was sort of a crown on
the head, the eyes were sightless, and the whole
expression was revolting and beastly.</p>

<p>What kind of people made and what kind of
people worshiped such a god I wondered.
I was not surprised that my little mistress had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
hid it away, nor that the one that came down
through Sir Geoffrey’s line had been lost. If
I had possessed it, I would have destroyed it
long since. It fairly radiated evil, and the contrast
between my lady’s face, all sweetness,
purity, and light and this hideous image was the
more marked. She has since confessed that she
drew the same contrast between it and what she
was pleased to call my brave and honest countenance!
But of that more anon. We stared
from the image to the parchment and then
looked wonderingly at each other.</p>

<p>There was much in the letter, of course, that
we could not possibly understand. We could
only comprehend it fully if we were lucky
enough to stand beneath “ye Stone Goddes,”
of which I held a sample in my hand, on the
island itself. Still the general purport was
sufficiently clear. Sir Philip Wilberforce had
evidently concealed a very considerable treasure
there. If we could find it our fortunes would
be made, or hers rather, for I swear I never
thought of myself at all.</p>

<p>“Think you,” my little mistress began at last,
her pale face flushing for the first time, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
bosom heaving quickly, “that the treasure may
still be there watched over by those awful gods?”</p>

<p>She glanced at the image I still held in my
hand as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Who can tell?” I answered. “I am probably
as familiar with the South Seas and their
islands as any sailor; which is not saying a very
great deal, for there are thousands of islands in
those unknown seas which have never been visited
by man, by white men, that is, or by any
race which preserves records. I have never
heard even a rumor of the Island of the Stairs,
yet it would seem to be sufficiently different
from all other islands to have been published
abroad if it had been discovered. Its latitude
and longitude place it in unfrequented seas
among others peopled by races of savage cannibals.
I think it not at all unlikely that it
may have remained unvisited by any who would
appreciate the value of the treasure since Sir
Philip’s day.”</p>

<p>“But would such treasure last so long?”</p>

<p>“Stored in a cave, gold and silver and jewels
would last forever. Everything else would
have rotted away probably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“It says to the value of millions of pounds,
you notice,” she repeated thoughtfully, pointing
to the parchment again.</p>

<p>“Aye,” I answered, “there is nothing unusual
or unbelievable in that; the cargoes of those
old Spanish galleons ran up into the millions
often, I have read.”</p>

<p>“How could we get there?” she asked.</p>

<p>“If you had a ship,” said I, “well commanded
and found and manned you could reach the spot
without difficulty.”</p>

<p>“How much would it cost?”</p>

<p>Well, I quickly and roughly estimated in my
mind the necessary outlay. Such a vessel as
she would require might be bought for perhaps
twenty-five hundred or three thousand pounds;
provisioning, outfitting, together with the pay of
the officers and the crew, would require perhaps
from fifteen hundred to two thousand five
hundred pounds more, or a total of between
five and six thousand pounds. And she had but
two!</p>

<p>I was about to tell her the prohibitive truth
when the solution of the problem suddenly came
to me. In one way or another I had been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
fortunate voyager and I had saved up or earned
by trading and one or two adventures in which
I had taken part, something over four thousand
pounds, which was safely lodged to my credit
in a London bank. Her fortune was two thousand
pounds. Alone she could do nothing, together
we could accomplish it. I had no right
to put the suggestion in her mind, but I did it.</p>

<p>“I should think,” I said slowly, “that two
thousand pounds would be ample to cover
everything.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said triumphantly, “exactly the sum
that Master Ficklin said was left of my mother’s
fortune.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, and then I added in duty bound,
“but you surely would not be so foolish, Mistress
Wilberforce, as to risk your all in this wild
goose chase?”</p>

<p>“If you were in my position, Master Hampdon,
what would you do?” she asked pointedly.</p>

<p>“I am a man,” I answered, “accustomed to
shift for myself. I might take a risk which I
would not advise you to essay.”</p>

<p>“I must shift for myself, too,” she said, her
eyes sparkling. The Goddess Fortune which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
had ruined her father was evidently jogging her
elbow. “Indeed, I shall take the chance,” she
persisted. “I am resolved upon it.”</p>

<p>“But you could easily live on two thousand
pounds for a long while,” I urged, against my
wish, for I was keen to go treasure hunting with
her for a shipmate.</p>

<p>“Not such life as I crave. If I cannot have
enough for my desires I would be no worse off
had I nothing.”</p>

<p>“But it is a long chance,” I persisted, “upon
which to risk your all.”</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she said solemnly, “the
fact of the separation of those two pieces of
parchment for a century and a half, and the
fact that they come together in me, one half
received from each of the dead who in neither
case knew of the existence of the other half, the
fact that I am Sir Philip Wilberforce’s last
descendant through both the original heirs—see
you not something providential in all this?”</p>

<p>“A strange coincidence,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“More than that,” she protested.</p>

<p>Well, I was arguing against my wishes and
from a sense of duty, so I at last gave way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
After all, the treasure might be there. If so,
it was hers and it would be a shame not to
get it. The pulse of adventure leaped in my
veins.</p>

<p>“So be it,” I said.</p>

<p>“Will you help me to make my arrangements,
you are accustomed to the sea, and—”</p>

<p>“I will do more than that,” said I, “with your
gracious permission I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“To the island?”</p>

<p>“To the end of the world,” I replied, whereat
she stared at me a moment, then looked away.</p>

<p>She extended her hand to me and I tried to
kiss it like a gentleman. I made, no doubt, a
blundering effort, but at least it was that of an
honest man.</p>

<p>“I must go and get ready to go to Master Ficklin’s
in the town,” she said softly. “You know
the house.”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Come to me there tomorrow and we will
talk further about the project.”</p>

<p>“Can I be of any other service?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” she answered, “you have been of
great service already. I shall not forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>And so I turned and walked out of the hall,
leaving her standing there for the last time, at
least so we thought, the last little descendant of
a brave race. But you never can tell what the
future will bring forth. I little dreamed that
she and I were to stand there again some day
under quite different circumstances. It is a
good thing for me that I did not dream that
dream then. It would have turned my head if
I had.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<span class="small">WHEREIN THE DUKE IS MARKED IN FAREWELL</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN we broached the subject of our
treasure hunting expedition to Master
Ficklin the next day at his house, he would not
hear of it. He examined the parchment with
interest, but pooh-poohed the tale because,
forsooth, it had no legal standing and was
couched in the language of the sea rather than
in the dry verbiage of the law. He pointed out
that he had only succeeded in saving this last
two thousand pounds of my lady’s fortune because
he had skillfully concealed its existence
from Sir Geoffrey, foreseeing that all that he
could come at would be recklessly flung away in
the baronet’s mad battle with fortune. He felt,
he admitted to us, some compunctions of conscience
about having hidden this little remainder
from his friend and patron, and then he pleaded
artfully that as he had gone against his sense of
right for the sake of preserving this money, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
wishes as to the spending of it ought to be respected,
especially when they concerned so intimately
the welfare of my lady; for, he asked
pertinently, what would happen to her when all
was gone and she had found no treasure, the very
existence of which he affected to disbelieve?</p>

<p>A very hard-headed, practical person was
Master Ficklin. He was not cut out for an
adventurer, that was patent. Still his statements
and propositions were entitled to the highest
consideration. His arguments, indeed, appealed
to my better judgment and I seconded
them to the best of my ability in spite of my own
desires. I was born with a roving spirit, and
in my own blood ran something of the gambling
strain, and the longer I dwelt upon possible
treasure the more alluring grew the prospect of
searching for it, and the more certain I became
that it was there. It is so easy to persuade ourselves
of what we wish.</p>

<p>Besides, even if there were no treasure, I luxuriated
in spirit at the thought of the long
months’ intimate companionship at sea with my
Little Mistress. It is true she already honored
me with her friendship, but in no other way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
could I hope to enjoy much of her society in the
future. She was too young and too beautiful
for obscurity. Sooner or later true men would
love her, the gay world would seek her out, she
would enter upon her proper station again, and
then where would I be? Selfish! Aye, but I
am frankly telling the truth in these rambling
recollections, even to my own discredit, though
my lady will not have it so.</p>

<p>But I had stern ideas of duty, too, and Master
Ficklin’s good sense ever appealed to me. Yet
when did mere good sense serve to persuade a
woman against her wish? My lady would fain
challenge fortune on her own account. She was
of age and what she had left was absolutely in
her control, but had she been but sixteen I make
no doubt she would have had her way. She has
ever had that way and ever will have it, so far
as I am concerned. Worthy Master Ficklin has
gone to his well-earned rest these many years
as I write, but I am quite warranted, I am sure,
in saying the same thing for him.</p>

<p>Well, the end of it was she made over her two
thousand pounds to me without requiring me to
give any bond, which Master Ficklin would fain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
have insisted upon. This would have been embarrassing
indeed for me for my bond would
have been my own capital which I was going to
embark in the enterprise in secret. I had saved
up that money with no one knows what foolish
dreams. I now realized these dreams possibly
would come to nought. Well, what difference?
I had no one dependent upon me, brother or
sister I had never been blessed with, and father
and mother were both dead long since. I was
alone in the world. What need had I for the
money?</p>

<p>I could always get a berth on a good ship as
mate, or perhaps as master, for which I was
fully qualified; and I could always earn enough
for my needs and to spare. Let her have it
whose need was great and whose desire was
greater.</p>

<p>I might have bargained for a share of the
treasure did we find any, but I scorned to do it.
I would fain give all and expect nothing. There
was a certain salve to my pride in becoming a
benefactor to the woman I—But I must not
anticipate in my story, trouble came soon
enough, as you shall see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>At any rate, not being in too great a hurry,
although I was constantly urged to action by
my lady, who could scarce possess her soul in
patience before she began her treasure hunting
once she was resolved upon it, I looked about a
good deal in order to get just what I wanted.
Finally from a merchant of Plymouth I purchased
a stout little ship of three hundred and
fifty tons burden called <i>The Rose of Devon</i>,
which had been engaged in the West Indian and
the American colonial trade. The name caught
my fancy, too, for was not my Little Mistress the
Rose of Devon herself? You that read may
laugh at me for my posying thought if you will;
I care not, for it is true.</p>

<p>It was my first design to have gone as master
of her myself and my lady would fain have had
it so, but after reflection I decided it were better
to have a much older man than I to command so
long as she went as passenger, so I engaged a
worthy seaman, one Samuel Matthews, old
enough to be my father, with whom I had often
sailed, in fact the man under whom I made my
first cruise. I did engage myself as mate, however,
and I even tried to induce Master Ficklin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and his sister to go with us, whereat that worthy
couple held up their hands in horror, preferring
the one his musty parchments and suits at law,
and the other her well ordered house and spacious
garden. I was not sorry for their decision.
I wanted to be alone on that ship with Mistress
Wilberforce, with what vague idea or aspiration
I dared not admit even to myself.</p>

<p>It seemed proper, in venturing among islands
filled according to common report with savage
peoples, to make ready for fighting; therefore,
after consulting with Captain Matthews, whom
I fully acquainted with the entire project in all
its details, I shipped a crew of thirty men and
I provided in the equipment plenty of muskets,
pistols, and cutlasses with the necessary powder
and ball and, in addition, a small brass cannon
which I mounted on the forecastle. Nor did
our cargo lack means for friendly trading and
barter among the natives should such be found
practicable.</p>

<p>Naturally, the unusualness of these preparations
attracted some little attention and although
Captain Matthews and I kept the destination
of the ship and the purpose of the cruise strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
private, we were overwhelmed with applications
from adventurous men who desired to make the
voyage, surmising that it was after treasure of
some sort and that it would be vastly different
from the monotony of an ordinary merchant
trading cruise. Clearance papers were got out
for the South Seas, which added the touch of
romance that those waters always have, for an
appeal.</p>

<p>Being so engaged with these larger matters,
perforce I left the work of signing on a crew to
Captain Matthews. He had as boatswain a
veteran seaman named Pimball in whom he
placed great confidence. He was a villainous
looking man with a white scar running from his
left eye across his cheek, caused by a cut he had
received in some fight, and the line of white
showing against the bronzed, weather-beaten
cheek he sported, did not improve his appearance.
But that he was a prime seaman was evident.
Captain Matthews reposed much trust in him,
somewhat to my surprise, for I was not prepossessed
by his appearance, but the contrary. In
answer to my objections he pointed out that many
a man’s looks belied his character, and although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Pimball was certainly ugly, he was undoubtedly
able. He had cruised several voyages with
Captain Matthews and had always shown himself
both experienced and dependable, so I let
it go and he and Pimball selected the rest of the
crew. It had been better for us in the end if I
had got rid of the man as I wished. Or would
it? Well, it would certainly have been better
for Master Pimball and his friends.</p>

<p>To anticipate, when we boarded the ship I
liked the crew not much better than the boatswain.
I will say this for them, however, that
a smarter, quicker set of seamen never hauled
on brace or lay out on yardarm. It was not
their skill or strength or courage that I misliked,
no man could fault that, but they were not the
sort of men I would have sought for a ship of
my own; and the presence of my lady and her
maid, a worthy woman, a long time servant at
the castle, who had elected to follow her fortunes,
perhaps made me unduly timorous; yet
I was not unusually or extremely apprehensive.
I had a sublime confidence in my own ability to
deal with any man or any group of men. I had
no doubt that Captain Matthews and I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
be able to master them and bend their wills to
ours at the cost of a few hard words backed by
a ready rope’s end or a well-used marlinspike or
belaying pin.</p>

<p>I did not stint the outfitting of the ship, and
when I finished, having left nothing out of her
manifest that either mine own or Captain Matthew’s
experience or imagination could suggest,
including everything conceivable for the comfort
of my lady, there remained of our joint
funds enough to pay the wages of the officers and
of the men out and back and no more. That is
allowing a year for the round voyage. The
lines of <i>The Rose of Devon</i> were unusually good;
she had a reputation for being a speedy vessel,
and that was more time than enough. It was
my purpose to go on around the world with her
rather than retrace our course about Cape Horn
after we reached the island, if we ever reached
it. So we staked everything we had on the
future. If my lady had possessed the least
knowledge of the value of ships, she would have
seen how little way her two thousand pounds
had gone, but she was as guileless as any other
woman on that subject, and Master Ficklin was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
not much better. I lied to them both, although
with a somewhat uneasy conscience. Yet it was
for her sake. My family had followed hers for
I know not how many centuries. They had
spent themselves for hers. I was only keeping
up the traditions in placing all that I had at her
service.</p>

<p>But one thing which happened before we embarked
occurs to me as worthy to be chronicled.
When all was ready and everything aboard, I
went back to Master Ficklin’s in Tavistock,
which was an easy day’s journey from Plymouth
Sound, where <i>The Rose of Devon</i> lay, to fetch
my lady and her maid. Master Ficklin’s house
was a somewhat large one for an attorney and
was surrounded by a walled garden, perhaps
two acres in extent, which ran from the back of
the house to a little brook which bounded the
village. There were a number of fine old trees
in it and much shrubbery and it was a pleasant
place in which Mistress Wilberforce and I had
spent some, to me, very delightful hours in perfecting
the plans for our great undertaking.</p>

<p>Master Ficklin was at his office, although it
was yet early in the morning when I called, intending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to fetch my lady to Plymouth by coach,
a special coach which I had engaged for her
particular use, by the way. His sister said that
Mistress Wilberforce was in the garden and that
she had company. She offered to show me to her
presence, but I said I knew the way and could
go myself. I did not like the word company
over much. Her fine friends had more or less
forgot her. One or two of the old families which
had been associated with hers had offered her
such hospitality and such comfort as they had,
until she could decide otherwise; some of the
women had called upon her, one or two men had
sought her out, but she was a proud little woman,
as you can divine, and would have none of them.
She had dropped out of their lives and latterly
no one had disturbed her, therefore I was perturbed
at the tidings.</p>

<p>I passed though the hall, out of the back door
and into the garden. The path to the brook
wound and twisted so that you could not see the
stream for the trees and shrubs. I stood a moment,
hesitating, wondering whether after all I
had the right or the privilege to break in upon
such company as she might be entertaining, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
a scream which came faintly from the end of
the garden, decided me.</p>

<p>I broke into a run and in a few moments came
upon my lady struggling in the arms of a man.
What man, do you ask? None other than
his grace, the Duke of Arcester! He had his
arms around her and although he was no great
figure of a man, he was much stronger than the
slight girl he was grappling so roughly. He
held her tightly by the waist with one arm and
with the other was trying to turn her head so
that he could kiss her fairly on her lips.</p>

<p>I was upon them before either realized my
arrival. In my fury I grasped the duke by the
collar of his coat with my left hand and with
my right I ruthlessly tore him away from my
lady.</p>

<p>“Thank God, you have come!” she cried, reeling
and staggering, her face flushed, her hair
disheveled, her dress in disarray.</p>

<p>I heard that much and then the duke was upon
me. Gritting his teeth and swearing frightful
oaths, he got to his feet—I had thrown him
prone—dragged out his sword and rushed at me.</p>

<p>“You dog!” he cried, “you have balked me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
before and you interfere now. I have had
enough of you, and the world has.”</p>

<p>He did not intend to give me any chance to
defend myself apparently. My little mistress
screamed. I heard her call my name and I suppose
she thought I was done for, but sailors are
proverbially quick-witted, footed, and handed,
and I was not the least alert of seamen for all my
size. I was wearing a hanger, a much heavier
and more unwieldly weapon than the duke’s
dress sword, but its weight was a matter of no
moment to an arm like mine. I sprang aside
as he lunged furiously at me, drew it, and the
next moment our blades clashed in earnest. For
myself, I rejoiced in the opportunity. Some
men of humble birth might have been disturbed
at the thought of crossing swords with a great
noble, but nothing of that occurred to me. I
wanted to show my lady, I confess, that even with
gentlemen’s weapons I was this man’s master.
And so I fell to it eagerly.</p>

<p>Now I am a good fighter and no mean fencer.
I can cross blades with anyone on earth. I did
not know all the niceties and refinements of the
game. I lacked grace perhaps—but when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
came to attack and defense, there were few men
who could beat me—certainly the duke was not
one of them. My swift play must have looked
to the duke as if I were surrounded by a wall
of steel. Therefore, he realized at once that his
only chance lay in the energy and rapidity of
his fence. He was as passionately incensed as
I, if from a different cause. Lunge succeeded
lunge with lightning-like speed. I will admit
that I was hard put to it for a time. The play
of light on his blade fairly dazzled me. It was
with the greatest difficulty that I parried. But
my lord was not built for the long continuance
of such violent exercise. Sweat ran into his
eyes, his thrusts grew less swift, less sure, if not
less vicious in their intent. I could feel his
growing weakness with my blade. After a few
moments I saw that I had him. It was now my
turn to attack. Something of the berserk madness
of my Saxon ancestors suddenly filled my
veins. I beat down his defense by a series of
terrific blows and finally shivered his sword.
He stood before me panting, weaponless, yet to
give him his due, more or less undaunted. I
raised my own blade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Would you strike a defenseless man, cur?”
he cried haughtily, still not blenching.</p>

<p>“You had no scruple in attacking a defenseless
woman,” I replied. “Nay,” I thundered as
he made a sudden movement, “stand where you
are. What I shall do to you depends upon what
I hear. If you move I swear to you that I will
beat you down like the villain that you are.”</p>

<p>I was amazed afterward at my temerity in
thus addressing a duke, but you will understand
my feelings. Without taking my eyes off of
him, I next addressed myself to my lady, who
had shrunk aside and watched us breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me now, Mistress Lucy,” said I
softly, “what this man proposed or said? I can
see what he did, but what were his meaning and
intent?”</p>

<p>“He—he—wanted—me to go with him,” faltered
my lady.</p>

<p>“He renewed his offer of marriage?” I asked
with a sudden sinking of heart.</p>

<p>I had a good deal of reverence for the nobility
except in the heat of battle, and even as bad a
man as Arcester was nevertheless a duke and a
great personage. That should mean something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
to a woman. Perhaps my lady might wish to
marry him after all!</p>

<p>“No,” whispered the girl, and at her answer
my blood burned for her.</p>

<p>“My God!” I cried, “did you dare to—”</p>

<p>“Why should I marry a penniless baggage?”
he sneered. It was a reckless thing to do, seeing
his helpless position. “She would not go with
me, she refused even to take my hand, the little
fool, so I seized her. Was it because she preferred
you, yokel?” he added.</p>

<p>“For whatever reason she refused the proffered
honor, she has had a lucky escape.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, clodhopper, for I should have
discarded and forgot her when her prettiness
had faded, but you—”</p>

<p>“I shall ensure that you will remember all
the days of your life what you tried to do; the
insult that you put upon this lady,” I said
quietly, although I was blazing inside.</p>

<p>“Would you kill me?” he cried, and I believe
I detected a note of alarm in his voice for
the first time, as I stepped nearer to him.</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “that would be too quick and
easy an end to your punishment. I will put my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
mark upon you, her brand as a blackguard.
Everybody who sees you will ask you about it
and you can explain it as you will. Two persons
at least will know what the mark signifies, my
lady and myself.”</p>

<p>He stared at me absolutely uncomprehending,
but before he could make a move I caught him
around the breast, pinioned both his arms to his
side with one arm and then I deliberately shortened
my sword, holding it by the blade, and cut
two long, deeply scored, rough gashes crosswise
in his right cheek. He struggled and shrieked
horribly as I did so and my lady screamed as
well, but I held him close until I finished. He
was a handsome man, but those two scars,
roughly crisscrossed, would never be eradicated,
for I had cut deep with deliberate purpose.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I to my little mistress, “before I
release him one more question. Did he—did
he kiss you?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Mistress Wilberforce faintly.</p>

<p>“Good,” I continued grimly, “had he done so
I had marked the other cheek.”</p>

<p>After that assurance of hers I released him
and he staggered back, trembling and shaking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
spitting blood, his cheek bleeding, a horrible
looking object.</p>

<p>“That will be a lesson to your grace,” said I
grimly, “not to insult an honest woman. I have
no doubt there are many who would rejoice
to see you now and to know why I have put my
mark upon you.”</p>

<p>“I will have the law on you. I will have your
life,” he sputtered out.</p>

<p>“You can have anything you want,” said I
recklessly. “I am your master with the sword,
and your master with everything else. Now
go.”</p>

<p>He turned and staggered away and that was
the last I saw of him. I heard later that he had
had the devil’s own time explaining those marks.
He proclaimed that they had been inflicted by
a madman, which was nearly the truth, but in
some way the story leaked out and I should judge
that my vengeance for the insult to my lady was
as adequate as anything could be. He never
lived down the tale, and I take it he was glad
when he received a mortal wound in a duel from
the hand of some other avenger of a woman’s
wrong some years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Master Hampdon,” whispered Mistress
Lucy, in an awe-struck voice, as we went together
through the garden, while I wiped my sword
with leaves, “why did you do that? ’Twas
horrible.”</p>

<p>“Why, mistress,” said I, striving to speak
formally, “when I saw you in his arms I could
have killed him.”</p>

<p>“But to mark him thus forever—” she began.</p>

<p>“Enough,” said I, with one of those flashes
of imperiousness which always amazed me afterward
and which really seemed to affect her
strangely, “he only got his deserts.”</p>

<p>“But he will take his revenge on you,” she
persisted.</p>

<p>“Let him try,” said I indifferently. “But I
am come to take you to the ship. We must get
there tonight to sail with the beginning of the
ebb tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” she said, putting her hand upon
my arm with unwonted humility.</p>

<p>We went into the house and from there to the
coach with her maid and her baggage, after
making her farewells to her kind host and
hostess. In the evening we got aboard the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
where I saw her safely bestowed in the comfortable
cabin I had arranged for her and for
her woman. When day broke and she came
on deck, we were under way for the Island of
the Stairs. The great adventure had begun.</p>

<span class="small">IN WHICH I AM PUNISHED FOR MY PRESUMPTION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;PASS over the events of the next six months
without comment, but not because they were
uninteresting. Oh, no. One could not sail
from Plymouth, England, to the South Seas,
touching at Madeira, the Canaries, Rio and
Buenos Ayres and rounding the mighty and fearsome
Cape Horn, without seeing many things
of interest and participating in scenes as dangerous
as they were exciting. But I am not writing
a book of travels, though perchance I may some
day endeavor to set forth for your delectation
some of my far voyagings in unknown seas.
Suffice it to say that we passed safely from the
much traversed Atlantic to the lonely Pacific,
and were drawing near to the island we sought
according to the calculations of good Captain
Matthews and myself, when something
happened.</p>

<p>I had brought it on myself, I realized, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
that made it no more bearable. Indeed, I was
mad, mad all through; outraged in dignity, humiliated
in self-respect, and were it not foolish
to speak so of a man of my years and standing,
I should say I was broken in heart. I suppose
that I should feel the wound to my affections
more than that to my pride later, but at that present
moment feelings of indignation predominated.
I had been a fool, of course, and I
should have expected nothing else; equally, of
course, perhaps I should even have anticipated
this, and probably if I had been in my right
senses on that day I would have known it. But
then you see, I was not in my right senses, and
that was the secret of my disgrace. And that it
all happened after half a year of the friendliest,
most pleasant intercourse between a man and a
maid only intensified the bitterness of the
situation.</p>

<p>My little mistress had been so kind to me
that I had dwelt in a fool’s paradise. I awoke
to realize that she had not forgot the difference
between our stations. She had been born in the
castle, I in the gardener’s lodge; she was of the
great house, I was of the cottage. I had forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
it in these long months at sea—by heaven, the
sight of her was enough to make a man forget
anything if he loved her as I! There, the secret
is out, though I make no doubt you guessed it
long before—but it seems she had not. There
was no mirror in the cabin, but I could well
guess that the sight of me was not sufficiently
prepossessing to make any woman forget our
respective merits and stations.</p>

<p>In birth, in breeding, in education, in everything,
she stood immeasurably removed from
me; so far removed that association on any terms
scarcely seemed possible. Yet she had been so
kind. I was her only confidant or companion
in the ship. I had forgot all that lay between,
or else, remembering, I had yet endeavored to
leap the gap. I had fondly hoped that the one
thing in me that was truly great, my passion for
her, would land me safely by her side. I did
not see how she could fail to comprehend it,
though I did try to disguise it.</p>

<p>Well, that love of mine—it had not brought
her nearer. On the contrary it had put me
under lock and key! And here I was, shut up
like a criminal in my own cabin in her ship, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
mine for that matter. Come to think of it, that
moment I believe love had completely disappeared.
I could recall—and can to this day—the
fierce, burning rush of color to her cheek
where I had kissed it; the fire of rage and surprise
mingled which sparkled in her eyes. The
Duke of Arcester I had marked for life for less
than this, I recalled in shame.</p>

<p>I hardly recollected the fierce blow of her
hand upon my face. That was nothing. I had
laughed at it as she had recoiled from me when I
had released her—actually laughed! I was not
laughing at her, God knows, but at her impotence
physically compared to my strength. She
was a small slender little body, I could have carried
her easily with my one hand—and I have
often done so since—yet she struck hard when
she did strike.</p>

<p>As I recalled it, I suppose that laugh was my
undoing. Perhaps she thought I laughed at
her. Well, what mattered it? Whatever the
cause, I was undone. All the patient devotion
of years, all the restraint of the long voyage had
come to naught.</p>

<p>There had been plenty of bright starlight on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
deck. She had stepped out from the dark
shadow of the spencer and I had followed hard
on her heels. The first night watch had not yet
been called and the men idle about the decks,
waiting the boatswain’s shrill whistle, had noted
it all. I can see their sneering, laughing faces
even now. God! I could bear anything from
her but nothing from them, and but for the sorry
figure I must have cut in a low brawl with the
ruffians, I would have leaped upon them and
fought them until they killed me.</p>

<p>As it was, I drew myself up and waited while
she sent for good old Captain Matthews and,
vouchsafing no explanations, imperiously bade
him stow me below as a prisoner in my cabin.
He didn’t relish the job but went about it forthwith.
Indeed, I did not wait for further orders
after her look and glance. I stalked below as
haughtily as you please. It was her ship, as
she had said and as she certainly believed, and
had it not been, who could deny her anything?
Not I, forsooth. I could steal a kiss but not
balk her will.</p>

<p>So here I was, the mate of <i>The Rose of Devon</i>—and
but for my own renunciation I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
her captain—engaged in this wild goose chase,
this foolish search for treasure, for so it seemed
to me then, locked up below like any mutinous
dog at the behest of a woman that I could have
broke between my thumb and finger. And
after all I had done and sacrificed for her, too.</p>

<p>The hot blood came into my cheeks again. I
remember I raised my arm and shook it toward
the door and then let it fall. What was the use?
I was her prisoner. I loved her, fool that I was.
I thought then and I think now I had rather be
her prisoner than be free and away from her,
than be free and know her not. No lovesick
boy could have been more foolish than I about
her—and, in your ear, I am so yet.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I had always loved her,
ever since those days when I, the gardener’s
boy, had been her faithful and devoted slave.
And through the long years when I had been
far voyaging in distant seas I had kept her memory
fresh and sweet and true. I had been in
many rough places, I had seen life from the
seamy side, the common lot of a sailor of my day
had been mine. I was not what you would call
a religious man; no, not nearly religious enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
but the thought of her and my mother had kept
me a clean man. In that respect, at least, I was
worthy of her; doubtless, I dare say, more
worthy of her than Arcester and Luftdon and
all the young gallants who had paid court to her
before her father lost his all and had blown out
his brains, leaving her but the parchment and
enough gear with my aid to charter and equip
the ship.</p>

<p>Such as it was, my heart was hers, and my
life had always been. As often as I could I had
come back to the old cottage where I was born
and for old time’s sake she had been kind to me.
I had craved even her condescension, although
it made me mad to see her surrounded by the
other men and women, so that I would fling
myself away and take the first ship that offered
to the farthest port. Yet, I always came back—to
her.</p>

<p>And I had been so glad that I was there when
Sir Geoffrey had killed himself and that I had
bought the ship and fitted it out and had been
able to do so much for her. As I said, she would
fain have given me command of the saucy little
<i>Rose of Devon</i> had I willed it—and sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
now for instance, I cursed myself that I had not
taken it rather than insisted that she should have
an older man, not a better seaman, than I.
There are no better seamen in narrow seas or
broad than I, if I do say it myself, who should
not.</p>

<p>I had worked my way up through the forecastle
to the quarter-deck. I had a natural gift
for figures. I could take a sight and work out
a position as well as any book-taught navigator,
and I had been a great reader, too. My private
cabin was crowded with books. A goodly portion
of my earnings was ever spent that way.
I had wit enough to choose good books, too, and
perseverance enough to study them well. And
they stared at me then from shelves built in the
bulkhead. What fond dreams I had indulged
in while I had pored over them, turning their
thin pages with my tarred, blunt fingers! I
walked over to them that night and struck them
with my fist in impotent rage. What was the
use of it? The stain of tar was on me forever
in her eyes.</p>

<p>And yet I knew more than she. Oh, much
more about everything but the usages of good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
society, and I had at least learned something of
good manners in her company since her father’s
death. Many a time I have caught her tripping
as to facts of knowledge, not daring, not even
caring to tell her; or, perhaps I had better say,
not wishful to humiliate her by showing her
that she was wrong, content to know that much
myself, and hugging my poor little superiority
to my heart. I knew more than she and more
than most of the men with whom she associated.
My shipmates used to laugh at me for being a
book delver, a worm, they were wont to call me.
Well, they didn’t laugh very long. There was
nothing physical for which I need stand aside
for any man. I was over six feet high and built
in proportion. I could unaided, and alone,
hold the wheel of the best ship in the fiercest
storm. I had matched myself against man and
against storm, not once but many times, and
neither the one nor the other had ever made me
back down.</p>

<p>Now I was a prisoner. I said I didn’t feel
that blow on the cheek, but as I thought on it,
it fairly seared me. I hated her, I hoped that—no,
I might as well be honest with myself—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
didn’t care how she treated me, how disdainful
were her words, how unjustly she punished me,
I loved her. I couldn’t help it, I didn’t want
to help it. I would fain kiss the deck planks
she hallowed with her footsteps.</p>

<p>There was another side to my confinement and
I presently took thought on that. I swear that
I was not thinking of myself but of her. I was
ever thinking of her. I could see dangers that
beset her as perhaps no one else could, and my
confinement added to her peril. She didn’t
realize that; nobody aft on the ship realized it.
I did not see any present way to make her understand
the situation. I had not cared to alarm
her before, and any attempt on my part to set
it forth now would be looked upon as a personal
plea, and yet there was a peril, imminent, menacing,
about to break, I feared.</p>

<p>You see, the fact that we were treasure hunting
had got about. Who told it I could not
discover, but the unusualness of our proceedings,
the arming of a peaceful merchant ship, the
indefiniteness of the articles, the clearing from
Plymouth for the South Seas, the absence of any
great amount of cargo, and the high wages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
promised had aroused suspicions. I had not
thought much about the crew, except of Pimball.
We had shipped a lot of smart seamen;
about the average in quality and above the average
in smartness, I decided as the days had
passed with nothing happening; but times were
good and ships were plenty, and we had sailed
rather late in the season, and Pimball had signed
many I could wish had been left ashore.</p>

<p>Her presence on the ship, too, was a mystery.
Alone in the little <i>Rose of Devon</i> with thirty
men! By evil mishap the maid she had brought
with her had died after a brief illness two weeks
out. Captain Matthews and I were for turning
back, but she said no, she would go on. We
had lost too much time already and her all was
embarked. We were now plowing the blue
waters of the Pacific and I, mate of the ship,
and the only other officer to be trusted, locked
up! Pimball, the boatswain, seemed to me to
be the least trustworthy of the lot. I had not
got over my initial dislike for him at all!</p>

<p>We were nearing the latitude and longitude
of the island. Suppose the men rose in mutiny!
I ground my teeth in rage at the thought. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
men liked me well enough, and I had been particular
to keep them in good humor, passing
over many a thing for her sake that I would
have followed with a blow had she not been
there. Captain Matthews had complained once
or twice of my laxity, but I knew things that he
didn’t, and I had done what I deemed best for
her. I pledge you my word that I didn’t care
a farthing for the treasure. I had never given it
much thought. I grew to believe in it less and
less as we got further from home, and if I had
been stronger for my duty and weaker in my
love I would have dissuaded her from the voyage,
following Master Ficklin’s lead.</p>

<p>Now that she was poor and alone, neglected
and forgotten, I had enjoyed a foolish dream that
I could be a companion to her—a life shipmate!—for
the captain was a rough, plain old sailor.
What a fool I was! and yet it had worked in
some way as I had intended. We had been
thrown into closer intimacy by the loneliness of
her position, and by my faithful and, until that
night, most unobtrusive, self-effacing devotion.
I was thinking too much of her to give my attention
to any other kind of treasure anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and I’d rather have had her than all the golden
argosies that plowed the seas.</p>

<p>I supposed it never entered her head that I
could presume to love her, consequently she was
less careful than she had been otherwise, and
that very night when I had poured out my
declaration to her, she had found no words with
which to meet it. I thought her motionless
silence was consent. I see now that it was petrified
amazement. I seized her in my arms, like
the brute she must have thought me, lifted her
up and kissed her fair on the lips and then on
her averted cheek. Arcester, the blackguard,
could have done no worse. I will never forget
how she stigmatized me, brute, coward, lowborn.
I don’t believe she had railed at that
scoundrel duke so fiercely. Well, I didn’t care
what she called me. Her safety, her life, her
honor demanded that I be released. That was
the paramount concern.</p>

<p>I listened—I thought I heard a footfall in
the outer cabin. Could she be there? I suppose
that I had been locked up for perhaps an
hour, aye, on the instant the bell forward struck
three. We kept man-o’-war customs at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
fancy. The sound came to me faintly as I listened.
Half past nine. She could not have
gone to her berth yet. She must be there in the
great cabin. I ventured to call.</p>

<p>Any man can imagine what it cost me to humble
myself to ask her mercy. Stop, I ought to
apologize. No gentleman—I do not mean the
dandies that made love to her—but no real
gentleman such as I, in spite of my low birth
and rough breeding, hoped I might prove myself
to be, would have taken advantage of her as
I did. Yes, an apology was certainly owing
from me. Even had it not been I should have
been compelled to make it for her sake.</p>

<p>I am a man of fierce temper, as you have
deemed and as you shall see, if you go with us
further in this history, but I can control it on
occasion, and I did it now. I shook the door of
the cabin gently at first and then vigorously and
called once and again. There was no answer.
I beat upon it. I raised my voice. I scarcely
thought I could be heard on deck. The wind
was blowing, the sea was heavy and the ship was
pitching wildly, the straining, the creaking, the
groaning of the timbers would have prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
such a noise as I made from attracting attention
unless someone were in the cabin.</p>

<p>But all in vain. No heed was paid to me and
yet I could swear that somebody was there. I
don’t know how exactly, but I was conscious of
her presence. Perhaps because I was so in love
with her that I could always tell whether she
was about. I can to this day. Many a time in
after years she has stepped into the room where
I have been sitting, without a sound, and has
come to me and laid her hand on my shoulder,
but I have had knowledge before she touched me
that she was there.</p>

<p>It made me madder than before to go thus
unheeded. I was on the point of giving over
my endeavor, but the thought of that peril in
which she stood, and the fact that I was removed
from the deck and a prisoner, made me resolve
on one more effort. She must be made to hear,
and if to hear, to answer.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I whispered softly, and then more
loudly, “Madam!”</p>

<p>I did not venture to say any other name. I
called again and yet a fourth time and then for
the last time with the full power of my voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
I heard a movement outside and then a voice,
beloved, blessed voice even when it rated me!</p>

<p>“Well, sir.”</p>

<p>The words came to me through the partition.
She was there then, as I had divined. She had
been there all the time, trying me.</p>

<p>“I would fain have a word with you,” I answered,
putting everything else by and speaking
most entreatingly and with a humility I did not
altogether feel.</p>

<p>“I desire no speech with you,” was her cold
and measured answer.</p>

<p>I could hear her turn as if to move away.
She had come very softly, but she went loudly
as if to show me her intention.</p>

<p>“Think of my long and faithful service,” I
urged, “and of your gracious friendship for me,
often expressed.”</p>

<p>“You yourself forgot it tonight.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake,” I cried desperately as I
heard her go, “just one word.”</p>

<p>“An apology? Do you beg for forgiveness?”</p>

<p>“No—yes—anything,” I finished in confusion.</p>

<p>“I will not listen. I wish to convince you of
the enormity of what you have done, the grossness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of your presumption. I will give you time
for quiet reflection, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am convinced already,” I urged hurriedly.</p>

<p>“So easily,” she mocked.</p>

<p>“Madam, if you love life and honor, I pray
you hear me. It is not of myself I think but of
you. You are in grave peril,” returned I with
the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>“What peril?”</p>

<p>There was a note of alarm in her voice in
spite of her effort to be indifferent. I seized
upon its promise eagerly.</p>

<p>“The men of the ship, they are not what they
should be. Captain Matthews is alone. Pimball
is a villain. I trust no one but—”</p>

<p>“And is that the plea on which you seek your
freedom?”</p>

<p>“That is the only plea.”</p>

<p>“You did not discover this danger until I
locked you up, did you?”</p>

<p>She laughed mockingly, but there was music
in her voice for me, albeit her words were harsh
and unjust.</p>

<p>“I tell you that it is not for myself I fear, but
for you,” I persisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“And was it for that you insulted me on the
quarter-deck before the men and—”</p>

<p>“No,” said I savagely. “By heavens, I did
that for myself.”</p>

<p>“Arcester could have done no worse,” she said
cuttingly.</p>

<p>“Curse Arcester!” I burst out, the mention of
the man’s name always inflaming me, “he would
have made you his—”</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the woman. “I will hear no
more. It is a foolish plea, the men are devoted
to me and—”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Mistress Wilberforce,” I
cried, but this time she was gone.</p>

<p>I heard the door of her cabin shut violently.
There was no help for it. Well, I must devise
some way unaided. For I must get out for her
sake. The cabin was lighted by an air port
closed by a deadlight. I measured it, drew
back the thick glass and examined the opening,
although I knew it was a futile proposition. A
slender boy might have slipped through but not
a man such as I. My mighty thews and sinews
and great bulk required a door and no small one,
either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>The wind had increased, it was blowing hard
outside and some spray came in through the port
as the waves slapped the side of the ship. I
closed and secured it; there was nothing to be
gained there. I must seek some other way.</p>

<p>I was not weaponless. Nobody had thought to
search my cabin, and a brace of pistols which I
always kept loaded and ready for an emergency
were locked securely in my chest. My hanger,
none of your dandified French rapiers but a
stout ship’s cutlass, ground to a razor’s edge,
heavy enough to paralyze any arm but one
muscled like mine, hung at the side of my berth.
It was the same with which I had marked the
duke.</p>

<p>The cabin door was a strong one. It was
locked and barred without. I might have
broken through it. I could have done so if I had
had space enough in which to run and hurl myself
against it. I might even have kicked it to
pieces with my heavy seaman’s boot. Certainly
I could easily have blown the lock off with my
pistol, but any of these endeavors would have
aroused the ship.</p>

<p>To let the sleeping dogs lie when you have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
means of controlling them should they awaken,
I have ever found to be a good maxim. I had
one other hope. If Captain Matthews should
come to the cabin I would appeal to him. For
the rest I determined not to sleep that night.
Some strange foreboding possessed me, such a
feeling a man has when his own hand is taken
from the helm and no other is near by to grasp it,
as if the uncontrolled ship must surely broach
to and founder.</p>

<p>We were near the latitude and longitude of
the island we were seeking, if indeed there were
such an island as was thought to be, and I
reasoned that the men would argue that now
would be a good time for an outbreak, especially
since I was removed. Would it come that
night? Would it come at all? Was I mistaken
in the men?</p>

<p>I have often wondered why women were made
and, since they were made, why men should be
such fools about them—yet I would by no means
unmake them! Here I was helpless just because
I had snatched a kiss from one. Although
I had ever been a decent man as man goes, I
had ventured as far as kisses with maidens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
here and there in this little world around which
I had gone so many times, and none of them had
ever taken it quite like that. To be sure, none
of them was like her. And now that I am in
the mood for confession, I might as well say that
I fully rejoiced in that kiss. It had not been
on the cheek first but full and fair on her lips,
and I had held her tight and drunk my fill—no
not that, of course; I could never do that, but
still it had been a man’s kiss on a maiden’s lips
fairly given, and—</p>

<p>Well, whatever happened, I had the memory
of that kiss. She would never forgive me. Of
course, there was absolutely no hope that she
would return my suit even in her poverty. She
was not for such as I, and if there was anything
in this old buccaneer’s parchment, if there was
an island, if she did get the treasure, why the
world would be at her feet again; and I, like
the fool I was, was helping her get it, to bring
that about. I was mad, aye, mad, with impotent
helplessness that night.</p>

<p>I sat there in the dark, no light being vouchsafed
to me and the lanterns in the outer cabin
not having been lighted, for a long time. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
wind rose and rose. The ship was pitching
madly. My room was on the starboard side of
the cabin and presently I heard all hands called
to reef the topsails. Captain Matthews was
alert and ready, of course. Presently he put the
ship about and with some of the canvas off her
she was steadier. There did not seem to be any
especial danger in the weather and for that I
was thankful.</p>

<p>I must have dozed. I was awakened by the
last echoing of the bell forward. I didn’t
know what time it was because I didn’t know
whether I had heard it begin to strike, but I
could count three couplets, which meant that it
was eleven o’clock at least. I didn’t know, of
course, that it was eight bells, midnight, until
after a shrill piping of his whistle the long-drawn-out
voice of the boatswain came to me
through the low bulkhead that separated the
trunk cabin from the quarter-deck above and the
’tween decks below.</p>

<p>“A—a—all the port watch! Show a leg,
lively, lads!”</p>

<p>I could hear the men of the watch below
grumbling and cursing as they turned out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
They had evidently been sent to their hammocks
after the topsails had been reefed for a couple
of hours in. I could also hear scraps of conversation
as they struggled into their jackets and
coats.</p>

<p>“Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>“Now?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Shall we kill him?”</p>

<p>“This is the best time!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye.”</p>

<p>“The old man’s alone!” and so on.</p>

<p>What I heard filled me with dismay. The
purport was plain. I picked up the pistol and
pointed it at the lock in the door. I had made
up my mind, come what might, to blow off the
lock and get free. Perhaps I could even yet
prevent and overawe them. Before I could
press the trigger, however, I heard a call on the
deck above me, a shot, a rush of feet, a scuffle,
oaths, curses, a cry for help, a groan, a fall!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<span class="small">WHEREIN I BARGAIN FOR A WOMAN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT dire misfortune had happened I
could well guess. Captain Matthews
had been attacked. He had promptly shot one
of the mutineers, and thereafter the rest had
killed him. My next impulse was to blow open
the lock of the door as I had intended, and rush
to avenge him, but wiser counsel prevailed and I
did nothing. I am, I think, somewhat cool-headed
in a crisis, and surely this was one. I
could wait. A loaded pistol was better than an
empty one, and to deal with me they would have
to come to me for whatsoever purpose they might
entertain, either to murder me or to release me.
In either event I could do more than if I rushed
headlong into the fray now. I could not help
poor Captain Matthews. I was sure that whatever
fell purpose they might entertain for my
little mistress would be in abeyance until they
had settled with me. I flattered myself that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
was too important to be disregarded by the mutineers.
Therefore, I carefully looked to my
weapons, seeing to the priming and slipping an
additional bullet in the barrel. After that I
stood by the door, weapon in hand, grimly ready
for the murderous mutineers.</p>

<p>I waited with every nerve strained to the utmost.
I also listened most anxiously for the
opening of the door of the after cabin which was
her own, but she must have been in a sound sleep,
indeed, for the door did not open. Evidently
she had heard nothing, mercifully she had not
been awakened. After all, if she had come into
the main cabin I think I must have come out
also, one way or another; but so long as she slept,
and so long as I could force the door when I
wished, I waited. It was not an easy task, but I
judged it best.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had not long to wait, for in less
time by far than I have taken to tell it, the hatch
was opened and a number of heavy-booted men
clattered down the companionway. The cabin
steward, of course, knew the arrangement of the
after part of the ship and he brought them
straight to my door. The key was in the lock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
outside and I could hear them turn it. I loosened
my sword which I had slung by its belt
around my waist, grasped my two pistols more
firmly, set my back against the side of the ship
and made ready for whatever came.</p>

<p>The door was pushed open abruptly and I
saw the cabin was crowded with men. At least
half the crew was assembled there, and it was
a little cabin, <i>The Rose of Devon</i> being but a
small ship. The rest, I guessed, were on watch.
I could not see the boatswain, evidently he had
the deck. The vessel could not be left unwatched
on such a night as this and in such a
sea, and he was the fittest man to take charge
of her. The steward had lighted both the cabin
lanterns, several of the men carried hand lanterns
which they had brought from the forepeak.
There was plenty of illumination to show their
villainous faces.</p>

<p>They were surprised to find me so prepared
and I gave them no time to recover.</p>

<p>“The first man,” I hissed out, raising my firearms
and leveling them at the group, “that tries
to enter this berth without my permission gets
a bullet through him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“We mean you no harm, sir,” gruffly spoke
out one who seemed to be a ringleader, a man
rated as boatswain’s mate, whose name was
Glibby.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here,” I asked, “in the
cabin at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, sir,” replied Glibby, “we’re
here to arsk questions, not to answer ’em.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I cried.</p>

<p>“We’re masters of the ship.”</p>

<p>“Captain Matthews?”</p>

<p>“He’ll cap’n no more ships on this or any
other seas,” answered Glibby with truculent
emphasis.</p>

<p>Now it rose in my mind to shoot him then
and there, murderous brute that he was—if I
had been alone perhaps I would have done it
without reckoning the consequences to myself,
but I had another to think of. Unless craft
stood me in good stead her case was hopeless.
And bad as Glibby was, Pimball was the chief
villain. No, I decided, nothing much would be
gained by killing the boatswain’s mate when the
boatswain lived. I trust no man will think me a
traitor or craven for what I said next. The idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
came to me on the instant and it seemed I could
do no better than adopt it. God forgive me if
it was wrong.</p>

<p>“Curse him!” I broke out with well simulated
heat, “serves him right. He disrates me and
locks me up here just for stealing a kiss from a
maid, and—”</p>

<p>“Spoke like a man of spirit, Mister Hampdon,”
cried Glibby, greatly pleased evidently.
“What did I tell ye, mates? He’s with us.”</p>

<p>“With you,” said I, carelessly pointing my
weapons downward but taking good care to keep
them ready, “I am with you, all right. What
do you propose? I am sick of the treatment I
received, and—”</p>

<p>“We want that ’ere treasure for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“And you shall have it, provided I get my
share with the other men,” I answered, scarcely
startled by their words, for this I had expected.</p>

<p>“We’ll share an’ share alike in everything,”
answered Glibby. “Am I right, mates?”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” came from the deep voices
of the men.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Glibby, “ship an’ treasure, an’—er—”
with a frightful leer—“woman!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>God! How I longed to clutch him by his
throat and choke him! My temper rose again,
but this time, as before, I managed to keep it
down though with immense difficulty, as you
may suspect.</p>

<p>“Come out into the cabin, Mr. Hampdon,”
said Glibby with a certain complacent civility
in his manner which he doubtless meant to be
engaging, but for which I hated him the more
if possible, “an’ we’ll talk it over.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said I. “Who is in command of
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Pimball, the bo’s’n, he’ll be in
charge of the ship,” answered Glibby.</p>

<p>“Very good,” I said, “I must talk with him
about the future. Do you go on deck, Glibby,
and send Pimball below and he and I with the
rest of you will soon settle this matter.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the boatswain’s mate,
turning to the companionway. “Pimball can
talk, him an’ you can come to terms, I make no
doubt.”</p>

<p>Now I couldn’t allow myself to hesitate for
the thousandth part of a second. They say when
a woman hesitates she is lost, but in a situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
like mine the man who hesitated would have
been lost, too. Ostentatiously again I shoved
one pistol into the belt that hung at my right
side, the other I dropped carelessly into the
pocket of my coat, and as Glibby clattered up
the ladder, I walked fearlessly, to all appearances,
out of the berth and into the cabin, the
men giving back respectfully enough to leave
me gangway.</p>

<p>“Now what is it that you propose, Master
Bo’s’n?” I began, sitting down at the cabin
table, while the rest ranged themselves about it,
some standing, some sitting on the transoms at
the sides, as Pimball came lumbering down into
the cabin.</p>

<p>For a second he was nearer death than ever
before in his life, or ever after but once, as you
shall see, but prudence as before held my itching
hand.</p>

<p>“We know,” began Pimball insolently without
further preliminaries, “that this ship’s cruisin’
for treasure. We know all we’ll git out of
the cruise is what we signed for an’ nothin’ more.
We’ve made a good guess that the island lays
hereabouts, an’ we mean to have more’n our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
wage. We’re goin’ to have our share of whatever’s
found that we’re after.”</p>

<p>“So you shall,” I said, “I’m with you in that.
I want something more than my wages, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s this woman, anyway?” broke out another.
“Why should she git it all? She’s a
mere girl.”</p>

<p>“You have said right, mate, who and why indeed?”
I answered smoothly, marking him down
for my vengeance when my turn came. “Now
what are your plans?”</p>

<p>“We want that ’ere map or chart that you’ve
been seed readin’ in your cabin,” said Pimball.</p>

<p>Now it happened that I was the keeper of
that parchment and of the little stone god. She
had appointed me their custodian. No one had
sought to steal them, but I kept the chart ever
on my person, and the idol in a locked drawer
in my berth. I didn’t know as to the value of
the chart; it might be immensely worth while,
it might not. At any rate, it was in a little bag
around my neck. I reached down, pulled out
the bag, took the torn parchment from it, and
threw the two halves on the table. There was
not the least use in my pretending ignorance or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
in refusing to give it up. They could kill me
and take it anyway.</p>

<p>“There,” said I coolly, “you have it.”</p>

<p>Pimball picked it up and looked at it searchingly,
matching the halves and scrutinizing it
dubiously.</p>

<p>“I can make but little out of it,” he said,
staring hard at it, and scratching his head, and
I doubted if the rascal could read a line for all
his assumption of knowledge.</p>

<p>“You can at least see the latitude and longitude
on it in the upper corner, can’t you?” I asked,
hardly suppressing my contempt for the man.</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s plain enough,” he answered, his
face lighting a little as he laid the chart down
on the table so that the others might see.</p>

<p>“And you see that little wavy line that runs
up from the lagoon over the top of what looks
like a wall to an opening in the side?” I continued,
determining suddenly to inflame their
minds with the treasure so that they would give
less heed to other things more important to me.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can make that out, too.”</p>

<p>“You see that little mark there?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i122.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“The treasure is thereabouts.”</p>

<p>Pimball turned around and faced the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
crowding about him in great and growing
excitement.</p>

<p>“Here, lights here,” he growled.</p>

<p>The men nearest him shoved forward with
their lanterns, illuminating the torn sheepskin
as they crowded around, and bent over the
table, as I drew back to give them room.</p>

<p>“Aye, I can make that out, too.”</p>

<p>“By—” burst out one hoarsely, “that’s the
spot.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” the boatswain asked
after a long stare.</p>

<p>“It means, if there is any truth in it, that the
treasure is thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“What treasure?”</p>

<p>“The plunder of a Spanish galleon.”</p>

<p>“An’ how did it git on the island?”</p>

<p>“It was buried in that cave there a hundred
and fifty years ago by one Philip Wilberforce,
an English buccaneer.”</p>

<p>“And how come this girl by news of it?”</p>

<p>“The story goes that this Wilberforce was one
of her forebears. His ship was wrecked and
finally he alone survived. He escaped, was
picked up and brought back to England with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
nothing but the clothes he wore and this parchment
in a bag round his neck. With all that he
had gone through he lost his mind for a space.
He recovered before he died enough to tell some
story. His sons quarreled. The story, with one
half of the parchment, went to one branch of the
family and the other, with the other half, to another.
They never got together again until her
father and mother, strangely enough the last survivors
of the two branches of the family which
had been so long separated, came together by
marriage, and after their death she pieced out
the secret.”</p>

<p>I told them the exact truth as you see. How
much of it they understood I could not tell.
Probably but little, yet the idea of the treasure
was real enough undoubtedly and my glib way
of rehearsing the story evidently made a great
impression on them.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Pimball, as I stopped for
breath.</p>

<p>“All that I know.”</p>

<p>“And you think there is treasure there?”</p>

<p>Now of late I had changed my mind, why I
know not, but I had; yet it would not do to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
tell them that, for I wanted so to fill their mind
with gold as to leave no place for woman.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” I answered vehemently—“gold,
silver, jewels, God knows what, everything
to make us rich forever.”</p>

<p>“And what do you reckon the value of it all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, several millions of pounds,” I answered
lightly as if the treasure was so great that a
million more or less was of no moment.</p>

<p>To the end of my life I shall never forget the
gleaming of their eyes, the covetousness in their
faces and their bearing, the tense silence broken
only by their deep breathing, the vulgar passion
for greed that suddenly filled the little cabin.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried out one old seaman suddenly,
and the cabin on the instant was filled with wild
cries, bestial, brutal shouts.</p>

<p>As the sound partially died away, I heard the
door back of me open. Now I had purposely
so placed myself as to be between the crowd and
the door. The door was opened but a little
way. I was conscious that my lady was at last
awake and listening.</p>

<p>“You’re the only navigator among us, Mr.
Hampdon,” began Pimball, smoothly enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
after the men got measurably quiet again, “an
if you’re really with us, you shall sail the ship
there to that island. We’ll git the treasure
aboard, sail away an’ sink her on the South
American coast, an’ then every man for himself
with all he can carry.”</p>

<p>“Am I to be captain?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There’ll be no cap’n, every man for hisself,
I say, but me an’ my mate, Glibby, will take the
watches in turn. You’ll navigate the ship an’
whatever is necessary for our safety we’ll do at
your order. Is it understood?” he went on with
a manner that was meant to be ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered I promptly, “but under one
condition.”</p>

<p>“We makes no conditions but what pleases
us,” said Pimball darkly. “We’re masters of
the ship, remember, an’ this is our last word.”</p>

<p>“It is not mine,” said I resolutely, yet without
heat, for I had yet the hardest part of the bargain
to drive and I must command myself if I were
to command them.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s got to be,” continued Pimball with
vicious menace, starting toward me with the
marlinspike he carried upraised, while others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
drew their sheath knives evidently prepared to
back up their leader.</p>

<p>“Now, my friends,” said I, coolly, “we might
just as well understand each other. You can
kill me if you want to, it would be easy enough,
but when you have killed me you have killed
your last chance at the treasure. You don’t
know what latitude or longitude we are in now,
there is not one of you that knows enough to
take a sight or to sail the ship to the island.
You are completely helpless without me. My
life means the difference between treasure and
no treasure to you. You are all smart enough to
see that.”</p>

<p>“He speaks right,” said an old seaman at the
back of the crowd.</p>

<p>“There stands a man of sense,” said I, “therefore
you will hear my conditions and accede to
them.”</p>

<p>“Heave ahead,” said Pimball roughly enough,
evidently not liking the situation but failing utterly
to see how it could be amended since I
completely held the whip hand of them all.</p>

<p>“What I stipulate is very simple. First of
all, I am to have my full and equal share of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
treasure with the rest. I am to be treated exactly
like the others in the division, and my life
and liberty, which are just as valuable to me as
yours to any of you, are to be granted me, as
I grant those of others.”</p>

<p>“Why, we told you that in the first place,”
growled out the boatswain, “if that’s all you’ve
got to say—”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“The woman.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the woman,” said Pimball slowly.</p>

<p>“What had you proposed to do with her?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Why—er I—er,” the man faltered, he actually
did not dare to say what had been in his
mind, and I’ve no doubt that my pistol never
looked bigger than it did when I quietly laid my
hand on its butt.</p>

<p>It was probable that the others had not as yet
decided what was to be done with her, whatever
Pimball may have determined upon. I took advantage
of their hesitation and pushed the matter
to a speedy conclusion.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said quickly, “I want her for myself.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Did I hear a groan in the cabin back of
me? If I did, I could not afford to hesitate, I
could not let them hear. “You saw how she
treated me,” I cried, raising my voice and banging
on the table with my fist; “she struck me,
she had me imprisoned. I want her to be given
over to me alone.”</p>

<p>“But—” began Pimball, not relishing the
abandonment of this prize which he had evidently
marked for his own.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, mates,” said I, disregarding
him and addressing the rest directly, “I am
a poor man and the treasure, or my share of it,
means a great deal to me, but revenge means
much more. You give the woman to me and I
will divide my share of the treasure among the
crew.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Pimball uncertainly, but the
sentiment of the crew under this appeal to their
greed was palpably against him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, man,” cried the sailor who
had spoken before. “Give the lad the wench.
When we git the treasure we can buy all the
women we need.”</p>

<p>“Aye, let him have her!” urged a second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“He’ll bring her to her knees,” said a third.</p>

<p>“This very night,” added a fourth with a hideous
leer and a horrible laugh.</p>

<p>“Stop it,” I cried, doubling my fist,—this was
no assumed rage either, for my blood was boiling
and I could scarce restrain myself longer.
“This is my own affair.”</p>

<p>The men fell back. They forgot for the moment
their advantage in numbers.</p>

<p>“Well, that is agreed at last,” said Pimball
reluctantly enough, “you takes the woman, we
takes the treasure.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” said I.</p>

<p>“Is that right, mates?” he asked of the rest.</p>

<p>“Right O,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“It’s all settled then,” said I, “but no—”</p>

<p>“Bring out the gal then an’ let’s see her,”
suddenly began one of the men, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether I could have controlled
myself any further or not. I rose to my feet, my
hand clutching the pistol. The lights danced
before my eyes I was so furiously angered. I
was about to raise my arm when she saved me.
The door back of me was thrown open wide and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
she stepped out into the cabin. How I thrilled
to see her, erect, fearless, more beautiful than
ever. She had thrown some sort of a robe about
her, and thrust her bare feet into slippers. She
had gathered the cloak over her breast with one
hand. Her hair was disheveled, but how beautiful
she appeared. The men recoiled and I
stepped back myself.</p>

<p>“I have heard all,” she cried, “you murderous
villains, to have killed my captain and seized my
ship, and you—you—” she turned to me, “to
have bargained for me and to have bought me
like an animal, a horse, a dog— Oh, if I had a
weapon!”</p>

<p>My pistol was still in my hand and she made
a clutch at it, but I was too quick for her. I
caught her by the wrist. The spell she had cast
upon us by her sudden entrance, her beautiful
presence, by her proud, brave demeanor was
broken by that touch. The men laughed. God,
the remembrance of that laugh makes my blood
boil even now.</p>

<p>“I wish you joy of her,” said one.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a time tamin’ her,” cried a
second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Ah, you think so,” I cried, determining to
carry out the deception to the bitter end and to
leave no chance for the least suspicion to arise.
I seized her by the shoulders, secretly praying
God to forgive me for what I was about to do,
and shook her violently back and forth. It was
easy enough. A baby in my hands would not
have been more helpless. “Silence, you fools,”
I cried as the men began to laugh again, and
then to her, “You belong to me, woman. Do
you hear? I’ve bought you. I am your master.
Get back into your cabin. I will have speech
with you later.” Helpless, amazed, petrified
with terror, she could do nothing. I thrust her
into the cabin, shut the door and faced the men.
“Will you gentlemen leave me alone to tame
this she devil for a little while, and I will be on
deck presently,” I panted out.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Pimball, “but before we
goes—” he pointed to a heavy bottle in the rack,
“I proposes that we drinks the health of the new
navigator an’ his lady.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said I, making the best of
that situation.</p>

<p>I reached for the glasses that were in the rack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and poured out a stiff dram for each man and
added mighty little water to it. The room was
soon filled with mocking, jeering toasts to my
health and happiness. I drank with them. I
have ever believed that when you attempt a
thing it is better to give your whole heart to it,
or you had better not try at all, and I did not
propose to spoil the game that had progressed
successfully so far, by not joining in. So I drank
with the others although I would rather have
swallowed poison. They went out one by one,
Pimball last.</p>

<p>“You’ll play fair with us, Mr. Hampdon,”
he said earnestly and suspiciously, too, “or—”</p>

<p>“You will play fair with me, or—” I retorted.</p>

<p>“There’s my hand on it,” he interrupted and
I took it, aye and shook it.</p>

<p>“I wish you joy of your woman,” he sneered.</p>

<p>“You will see how tame she is tomorrow,” I
laughed, as he climbed up the ladder and soon
disappeared.</p>

<p>My first instinct was to draw the hatch covers
and bolt them, but I didn’t dare. In fact, Pimball
himself kicked them together. I turned to
the shut door of her cabin. To throw open the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
door was the work of a minute. There she
stood. She had twisted some kind of a rope out
of the sheets of her berth which she had hastily
torn in strips. Her purpose was plain. She
had intended to end her life by hanging herself
from the hook in the deck beam above to which
one end of her rope was secured; and she would
have done it, too, if I had not come in in the nick
of time.</p>

<p>I stared at her for a moment and then reached
forward and tore the plaited strands out of her
hand and from around her neck and threw them
to the deck. It was evidence to me of the deepness
of her despair that she had attempted such a
thing. It showed me for one thing the excellence
of my acting for I couldn’t have conceived
that she would try to do away with herself if she
had the slightest suspicion that I was a true man
still. I had convinced even her of my villainy
I realized with a sudden pang.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<span class="small">WHEREIN I MAKE ALL CLEAR TO MY LITTLE
MISTRESS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARD as I stared at her, the glance that
she shot back at me matched my own.
I never want to see such loathing, such contempt,
such scorn on a human countenance
again—much less on her sweet face. It cut me
to the heart. Conscious of my own innocence
of wrong and unaware of the excellence of my
acting, I could not understand it for a moment.
That she had so far believed my own words
against her knowledge of my character and the
memory of my long, devoted, faithful service,
confounded me. I was appalled, paralyzed for
the time being. I didn’t know what to say, how
to begin an explanation. I stood there gaping
like a fool. It was she who broke the silence
that was becoming insupportable between us.
Come to think of it, the initiative—in speech at
least!—was invariably hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“A moment,” she said wildly, all her feeling
in her voice, “and I had done it, traitor!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” I protested, “I am a true man.”</p>

<p>“You bargained for me, you bought me.”</p>

<p>“I was not in earnest,” I started to say, but
she interrupted me in a perfect tempest of outraged
feeling.</p>

<p>“My God!” she burst out, “why didn’t you
stay away a little longer and I had done it? You
villain, you vile, low—”</p>

<p>But at that I found voice again, for I was
getting angry myself, my temper naturally being
none the sweetest, save ordinarily when she was
concerned.</p>

<p>“Hear me,” I interrupted in turn.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” she said imperiously.</p>

<p>“But indeed you must,” I persisted almost
roughly, stepping within her cabin and carefully
closing the door after me. “It is your welfare
alone that I seek. I think you should have
known that.”</p>

<p>“After the insult on the quarter-deck last evening?”
she asked cuttingly.</p>

<p>Now I confess I had forgot that small affair
in the graver matters that ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Never mind that,” I began most unwisely.</p>

<p>“Never mind it!” she cried, her face flaming,
“I shall never forget your insolence as long as
I live.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, controlling myself again
but with added difficulty, “our concern is not
with kisses but with—”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Life and—”</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>“What else? Speak on.”</p>

<p>“Your honor,” I said slowly, whereat she
stared at my face, now doubtless stern enough in
all conscience.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth to speak, but I silenced
her with a wave of my hand as I found I could
do on various occasions. I did not wish to hear
further from her then. What I had to say concerned
us both so deeply that I cared not what
she said and perhaps that closed cabin into which
I had penetrated was the likeliest place for
privacy in the whole ship. I could by no means
be overheard, so I determined to speak freely
and in a way not to be misunderstood. She
shrank back against the farther bulkhead as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
approached her. Her mouth opened to scream
evidently, although she must have realized that
a call for help would have but added to her
tormentors. But I stopped her before she made
a sound.</p>

<p>“I mean you no harm, can you not see it?” I
began. “It was all a play.”</p>

<p>“A play,” she panted, “the murder of the captain,
the mutiny of the men, the seizure of the
ship, the giving up the chart, your purchase—”
she drew herself up—by heaven, she was a brave
little thing—“of me,” she added, “with your
share of the treasure: was that a play?”</p>

<p>“Part of it, madam,” I answered, stung by her
scorn and stunned again by the thought that she
could ever have believed me capable of such
baseness, who had loved her, worshiped her,
and—but for that fleeting moment when I had
kissed her—had ever treated her with such
humble consideration and respect.</p>

<p>“Part of it,” she repeated, “what part?”</p>

<p>“My part.”</p>

<p>“Your part?”</p>

<p>“I am your humble servant now as ever,” I
said emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“My master, isn’t it, since you bought me?”</p>

<p>“God forbid, I bought not you.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“The right to live and serve you, the right for
you to live unharmed, and—”</p>

<p>“And what?”</p>

<p>“And be served by me with no thought but for
your safety and happiness.”</p>

<p>She stared at me for some moments in deep
perturbation and perplexity, her brow furrowed.
I had wit enough to be silent and let the speech
work.</p>

<p>“Have I wronged you?” she asked falteringly
at last.</p>

<p>“As to that, madam,” I returned firmly—oh,
I yearned to take her in my arms, to press her to
my heart, to call her sweet names, but I did not
dare—“you yourself must be the judge. But if
you will think a moment you will see that I had
no other course. What would your fate have
been, left to that murderous rabble on the deck
yonder?”</p>

<p>“I could have died,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Aye, of course, but not until after they had
done with you,” I said with a grim plainness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of speech, seeing no other way to convince
her, and pressing home my slight advantage
accordingly.</p>

<p>She shuddered as my meaning became clear
to her.</p>

<p>“You should have known me better,” I continued
a little reproachfully, “than to have
suspected—”</p>

<p>“But your insult to me this very night on the
quarter-deck and your indifference to it a moment
ago!”</p>

<p>Her cheek flushed at the thought of it in spite
of herself, and mine flushed, too, or it would
have colored had it been less brown, I have no
doubt.</p>

<p>“And is a man to be condemned beyond pardon
who has served you truly, because he
snatches a kiss in a moment of madness and forgets
it when your life and honor tremble in the
balance?”</p>

<p>“I did not think even you could forget that—ever,”
she said and I could not fathom exactly
her purpose in that remark.</p>

<p>Did she not want me to forget it? Or would
she have me remember it? But this seemed like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
trifling. I turned away bitterly, but she caught
me by the arm instantly.</p>

<p>“What are you about to do?” she began.
“Don’t abandon me now. I believe in you. I
see now why you did it. It was to save me and
help me. What would I do, what could I do,
without you? I am—” she hesitated, it was hard
for her proud spirit, and coming nearer faltered
out a few broken words. “I am sorry,” she
finished humbly, with downcast head.</p>

<p>“Say no more,” I answered, looking down at
the little hand on my sleeve, my soul thrilling to
her words and touch. “No harm shall come to
you save over my dead body.”</p>

<p>“I believe it.”</p>

<p>“But that is not enough for me to promise. I
mean to extricate you from this peril, to save
your life if I can, your honor in any case.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“If the worst came I would kill you with my
own hands rather than let you fall into theirs.”</p>

<p>“I would welcome death itself rather than
that,” she answered proudly.</p>

<p>“I believe it will not come to that,” I said. “I
hope to save you otherwise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“But is it possible?”</p>

<p>“I think so, I pray so.”</p>

<p>“You are but one against so many.”</p>

<p>“I have one ally in the ship, you forget,” said
I, smiling at her, relieved and thankful to see
her in her right mind again and awake to the
truth and to my real feeling toward her.</p>

<p>“And that is—”</p>

<p>“Yourself.”</p>

<p>“A feeble helper,” she rejoined, smiling in
turn.</p>

<p>“We shall see.”</p>

<p>“And will you forgive me for having misjudged
you?” she asked pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Gladly.”</p>

<p>“My hand on it then,” she said, holding out
her little palm, which I swallowed up in my
large one on the instant, standing silent as usual,
holding it the while.</p>

<p>“And are you not sorry that you—you—kissed
me?” she faltered at last.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered bluntly enough—being a
plain man I have always felt compelled to tell
the truth—except perhaps when her interests
were at stake—“I am not sorry,”—but as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
swiftly tried to draw her hand away I added, “I
promise you I won’t do it again, and you will
forgive me, I know. Meanwhile, we have much
to plan, we may be interrupted any time, and we
had best get at it.”</p>

<p>I released her hand and she faced me calmly
enough.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how much safer I feel when
I have you to depend upon,” she said.</p>

<p>How my heart leaped at that assurance for I
saw by it that she had indeed forgiven me.</p>

<p>“I shall leave everything to you, Master
Hampdon,” she continued. “Do you tell me
what to do and I will do it.”</p>

<p>“I know you will. I could not ask a braver,
better second,” I answered heartily.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard a step on the ladder.
Somebody was coming. Quick as a flash I
realized the part we had to play in public. I
balled my fist and struck the bulkhead savagely.
I suppose I must have changed my expression as
well for in her surprise, she screamed faintly.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” I whispered, “cry out again,
but louder, louder.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked hurriedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
with uncomprehending amazement—in this
crisis my wits working quicker than hers.</p>

<p>“There is somebody outside. We have a part
to play. I am abusing you and you are fighting
for your life,” I whispered swiftly, then louder,
fairly shouting at her, indeed, I cried out, “Down
on your knees, wench. You will find that you
have met your master now.”</p>

<p>I made some sound of scuffling and she did
indeed scream loudly. In the midst of the commotion
the door was tried, but fortunately I had
turned the key.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” I shouted, and to my lady
whispered, “beg for help, loudly.”</p>

<p>Entering into the spirit of the game and smiling
at me since there was none but me to see,
albeit she infused strange terror in her voice so
that I was amazed myself, she cried at the top
of her voice,</p>

<p>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p>I in turn called louder yet.</p>

<p>“Silence woman!” and struck the bulkhead
again.</p>

<p>Finally turning to the door I opened it a bit
and there stood one of the younger seamen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“What want you?” I began sternly and stormily.
“I don’t care to be disturbed just now.”</p>

<p>“Well, from the sound of your love makin’,”
answered the sailor insolently, “I shouldn’t
judge that you was gittin’ any for-ader.”</p>

<p>And here my little mistress showed her cleverness.
She had pulled her hair around her face
and somewhat disarranged her dress. She
sprang to the door and striving to pass my outstretched
arm, pathetically begged the seaman’s
assistance from this great brute, meaning
myself! It was well done and deceived the man
completely.</p>

<p>“I can’t help you,” he said. “I’d like to, Mistress,
but yon man’s bought you with his share
of the treasure an’ a bargain’s a bargain. We
must e’en stick to it, though, as I live, I think
you worth it,” he leered out at her.</p>

<p>“You see,” said I speaking harshly to her and
thrusting her with seeming violence away from
the door, “get back into your corner, curse you!”
And then to the man, I said, “Now what’s the
matter and what’s wanted?”</p>

<p>“You’re wanted on deck. It is jest dawn.
Land’s been sighted an’ there’s a heavy sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
runnin’. Pimball an’ Glibby want your advice
as to what’s to be done.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said I, “I will be with you in a moment.
Tell them I have yet a word or two to
say to this woman, here.”</p>

<p>The man turned on his heel, passed through
the cabin and climbed the ladder to the deck.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said quickly, thrusting one of my
pistols into my little mistress’ hand, “we can talk
no longer this time; I am going to do my best for
you and if I fail here is a weapon. You know
what to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Shall I use it on them?”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I answered grimly, “on yourself
if it comes to the worst.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said, paling a little.</p>

<p>“Lock the door when I go out and on no account
open to any voice but mine.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember.”</p>

<p>“And keep up the acting,” I said, “whimper
and cower away whenever we are seen
together.”</p>

<p>“I shall not forget,” she said, standing very
straight, looking at me bravely, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>“And now, good-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>I turned away but she caught me by the
shoulder. She extended her hand rather high.
I was not so dumb as not to understand what she
wanted and so I bent and kissed it, and it was
no light kiss of gallantry, but I pressed my lips
passionately against the little hand.</p>

<p>“May God keep you,” she said, as I turned
away, breathing the “Amen” I dared not speak.</p>

<p>I heard the key turn in the lock behind me and
with a heart full of misgivings in spite of my
stern and resolute purpose, I came out on deck
again.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<span class="small">IN WHICH WE ESCAPE TOGETHER FROM THE SHIP</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;HAD no idea that it was morning already,
the night had passed so quickly. The
eastern sky was already gray, and although the
day bade fair to be an unpleasant one there was
already light enough to distinguish land off to
starboard; that side of the ship on the tack on
which we were then standing, was to leeward.
We had run quite near it in the night. It was
still too gray to make out much more than the
existence of the land itself, but I thought I saw
beyond the nearest island others rising.</p>

<p>At any rate, there it was where it ought to be,
and I didn’t make any doubt but that it was the
island which we had been seeking these long
weary months at sea, especially as I recalled the
results of the sights which poor Captain Matthews
and I had worked out the afternoon
before. I felt no little pride in my navigation,
by the way. I had told her that I could find it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
and I had done so after sailing halfway round
the world.</p>

<p>The observation which I had taken then and
which I had checked off later, and which Captain
Matthews had also checked off by his own
shot at the sun, had shown us that we were in
about the latitude and longitude of the chart
where we might hope to sight land, if the island
of our search was not purely an imaginary one.
It had not been marked on any chart, to be sure,
and I had always felt some doubt about it. The
whole story was so strange and unreal, something
like a story-teller’s romance, that the longer I
sailed on the voyage the less real the whole
undertaking seemed. With the passing days and
the passing leagues I had changed my once confident
opinion.</p>

<p>Yet I knew that these parts of the ocean had
not been well charted, they were very infrequently
visited, and there might well be islands
here as well as in other parts of the South Seas
that no one knew anything at all about. I had
thus sought to reassure myself, and lo and behold,
there it was. I was glad then that I had
not spoken of my growing doubts to my lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Somehow the sight of that land set my pulses
beating. If there was land there, why should not
the rest of the story be true, why should there not
be treasure?</p>

<p>My confidence came suddenly back to me.
Yes, that must be the island and the treasure
must be upon it. I had professed to give up all
of my share to the crew for her—nevertheless, I
was not insensible to its value if it were there,
and I made up my mind if human strength,
human wisdom, human cunning, and unbounded
devotion could work it out, I would outwit the
crew and get all of it for her, although I realized
that riches would remove her at once further
than ever from me.</p>

<p>What of it! I couldn’t be further from her
than I was. She had shown me my presumption
and rebuked me properly for it, though indeed
she had forgiven me. She was born to be rich
and happy and if I could make her the one her
friends, old and new, would doubtless make her
the other. As for me—well, I could go off on
some longer cruise even than this and never come
back. Nobody would care. I didn’t have
much time to think about these things, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
resolution came to my mind then as I set it down
here.</p>

<p>The whole crew was on deck. I didn’t see
Captain Matthews’ body about, although I
looked hastily for it. I learned later that they
had tumbled the poor old man overboard after
they had knocked him on the head. He had
shot a mutineer before the rest killed him, and
he, too, had gone into the sea with the same lack
of ceremony—murdered and murderer together
to wait the final reckoning. Pimball, Glibby,
and one or two others of the older seamen were
on the quarter-deck, the rest being strung along
the lee rail in the waist, staring at the island.
Two good hands were at the wheel. The ship
was pitching and laboring heavily and it required
two men to hold her up to it.</p>

<p>Everything above the topsail yards had been
furled, of course, and during the night they had
taken a second reef in the topsails. A whole
gale was now blowing. <i>The Rose of Devon</i> was
a wet ship in a seaway, and she was making heavy
weather out of it. Every once in a while a wave
would slap her on the weather bow and send a
cloud of spray as high as the foreyard, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
by a torrent of water flooding aft. Fortunately
it was not cold. We were only a few degrees
south from the line so the water was warm and
nobody minded an occasional ducking.</p>

<p>I noticed one thing with satisfaction. They
had evidently not thought it worth while to
break open the arms chest or to force the key
from me, which they could easily have done,
and therefore none of them was armed. The
desirability of getting at the arms had not occurred
to them, or else, they being so many, and
I but one, they had not thought it worth while.
At any rate, save their sheath knives, weapons
they had none. Even Captain Matthews’ pistols
had been thrown over with the body, in their
hasty disposition of it.</p>

<p>“Well,” I began, as I climbed over the hatch
combing and turned aft.</p>

<p>“I sent for you, Hampdon,” began Pimball
insolently, and his failure to ‘mister’ me or to
give me any title indicated our present relations—and
of course I expressed no resentment over
his disrespect—“because o’ that,” he pointed to
the leeward toward the island, which we were
now sufficiently close to see easily in the growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
light, and to which we were rapidly drawing
nearer. “What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“It looks like land,” I said to gain time.</p>

<p>“It is land, of course,” he rejoined impatiently,
“but what land?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” I answered evasively. “I
have never been in these seas before.”</p>

<p>“Well, you took a shot at the sun yesterday,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“An’ where were we?”</p>

<p>I named a latitude and longitude, not exactly
what I had worked out but near enough. For
obvious reasons I didn’t want these ruffians to
know exactly where we were or to have any accurate
information on any subject. He pulled
out the chart as I spoke and compared its figures
with those I had given them. Evidently he
could read figures if not letters.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” he said after studying over the
map for a little time, “that ain’t far from the
p’int we’re makin’ for, is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I admitted, “not very.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that can be it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell for certain,” I replied, determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
not to commit myself, “until I get another shot
at the sun. I should think the latitude about
right, but as to the longitude—”</p>

<p>“An’ you can’t git no shot at the sun ’til noon,
can you?” unceremoniously put in Glibby, casting
a long look to the eastward where the sky
was thick and cloudy already.</p>

<p>“I can’t even get an observation then unless
we have clear weather,” I answered.</p>

<p>“There’ll be no clear weather today, I take
it,” said an old seaman, standing with the other
two.</p>

<p>“I don’t much think it,” I assented.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you advise, then?” asked
Pimball.</p>

<p>“That we stand on slowly during the day and
heave to at night, and if we can’t get a shot at
the sun, stay hereabouts until the sky is clear
and the sun visible, then we will know just
exactly what course to take and just what’s best
to be done.”</p>

<p>The advice was so self-evidently good, in fact,
the only practicable course, that there was no
hesitation in accepting it. Pimball, Glibby, and
the older sailors conferred together for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
minutes and decided that what I had said was
sensible. The boatswain stepped up to the
horse block, grabbed the trumpet, and shouted
his orders. Presently the ship was hove to with
the island well under her lee, distant perhaps a
league and a half or maybe two leagues. Personally
I should not have hove to a ship so close
to a lee shore. I should not have advised it and
indeed would have protested against it, had I
not suddenly developed a plan, a plan as desperate
as ever came into man’s head, but then the
situation required desperate remedies. And for
the accomplishment of the plan the ship was now
in the very best position I could have put her.</p>

<p>There were thirty able-bodied men on that
ship, not one of whom could have matched me
individually, but collectively I was nothing compared
to them. If that were the island for
which we had been headed, I did not want to
leave it without an inspection. Privately I had
no doubt but that it was, because, as near as I
could calculate from our last observation, it was
exactly in the spot where it ought to be, did the
parchment tell the truth. As I said before, I
prided myself on my navigation and I do still.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
It was no light thing to sail a ship from England
across the whole length of the Atlantic, round
Cape Horn and take her up into the tropics and
put her just where she ought to be; and I submit
that I had a right to be proud.</p>

<p>Well, if that were the island, I was minded
to desert the ship with my lady, get ashore and
trust ourselves to the tender mercies of whatever
natives there were rather than stay with the vessel.
The savages, if any there were, couldn’t do
any more than murder us, and, unless I could
shoot her first, the men would eventually treat
her, and me too, a deal worse than that. I took
no stock in their promises and agreements.
Once they got the treasure it would follow that
they would kill me and take her. So I made up
my mind to desert the ship with my mistress just
as soon as I could get away from her, and I
thought I could. Rather the natural savage than
the civilized one for us both, I decided. That
was my desperate design.</p>

<p>When we got <i>The Rose of Devon</i> safely hove
to, the men all knocked off work at once, leaving
the decks in a state of confusion. Indeed, save
to clear up the gear, there was nothing to do but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
wait. Two or three men were stationed on
watch and the rest were given the freedom of
the ship. I was in doubt as to what to say about
the cabin, but strangely enough nobody made
any effort to take advantage of the mastery of the
crew to quarter himself there. Indeed, their
quarters forward were almost as good as ours
and they evidently preferred to be together.
The ship was generously provisioned and the
fare of the men had been unusually good. They
did, however, break into the lazarette and help
themselves to whatever they liked out of the
cabin stores, including a case of bottled spirits.</p>

<p>I looked at that action with very considerable
alarm at first, wondering whether it would not
be wise or better for me to interfere, lest I should
be unable to control them at all when drunk. I
decided in the end not to interpose any objections.
In fact, I went further in pursuance of
my plan and I flatter myself that my design was
a brilliant one. From the cabin stores presently
I brought out other liquor and let them have as
much as they wanted. I even plied them with
it, playing the host with much profession of
generosity and hearty hospitality. A little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
liquor would make them ugly and intractable, I
reasoned, a great deal would make them drunk,
and enough would render them completely helpless.
I even joined them in their carousal. It
was easy enough to spill my portion and make a
pretense at drinking which soon deceived them.
They took to the liquor like ducks to the water
and voted me a royal good fellow and the prince
of pirates. I mixed the raw spirits with very
heady wines, too, being much astonished at their
capacity, by the way.</p>

<p>The men on watch kept reasonably sober for
a time, but even they were not any too abstemious.
I saw to that. Later on, the cook, who
was not yet too drunk, fixed them up a regular
banquet out of the cabin stores, and there was no
objection to my taking a portion to my lady in
the stateroom below, where she needed no urgent
entreaty to keep close and remain out of the way.</p>

<p>My communications that long day with my
sweet charge were necessarily much intermitted
and very short. I did not dare to be long away
from the men on deck. I still wore my sword,
and searching through the captain’s cabin found
two heavy pistols which I carefully charged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
concealing them in the deep pockets of my pea
jackets. I passed among the men freely, handing
out the spirits, opening fresh bottles and
bandying rough jests, but took care never to be
in any position where I could not command the
companion hatch which led to the cabin.</p>

<p>The day did not pass without some altercations
and quarrels. One man did endeavor to get
below but I was too quick for him. He was one
of the most unimportant among the crew and I
fetched him a sound buffet which laid him out—he
was too drunk to resent it successfully even
then—and which was greeted with a roar of
laughter by the rest.</p>

<p>“Play fair, Jack,” yelled Pimball drunkenly;
he was rather better humored in his cups than
out, it seemed; “he has give up his share of the
treasure for the girl. Let him have her,” of
which sentiment the rest of the villains apparently
were pleased to approve.</p>

<p>Our drift was slowly but surely in the direction
of the island. Indeed, I think we had made
half a league or more to leeward since we had
been hove to. From time to time I searched the
shore with a glass, seeing that the land was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
protected and completely enclosed by a reef on
that side at least, which agreed with the chart;
but the sky continued overcast and the mist grew
thicker, so I couldn’t make out much more than
that. It was land and that was enough. It was
big enough to support life, and I thought that I
detected green patches here and there that betokened
vegetation, and if so, there must be water
and where there was water there was certainly
life.</p>

<p>Nobody took any care to strike the bells, but
when darkness fell I declared noisily that I
would go below and turn in. All but the most
seasoned and hardy drinkers were by this time
dead-drunk. There was evidently some little
remembrance of my rank, for no one yet conscious
made any objection. Pimball, lying supine
on the deck, hiccoughed out that he and
Glibby, who was in no better case, would keep
the watches, so far as the ship needed watching.
I ventured to suggest that the ship could be left
alone without watch at all under the circumstances
and he stuttered out a complete agreement
over the bottle which he and Glibby
lovingly shared. The wind had moderated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
somewhat, although it was still blowing hard.
We set no more sail, however, and indeed, unless
we wished to drift past the island, it was not
necessary, especially as they still kept her hove
to. With drunken effusiveness they assured me
that they would take care of the ship and I went
below, having provided all of them with a fresh
supply of drink just before.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if I would not have been
justified in killing them all while they were rendered
thus helpless. But I could not bring
myself to such wholesale murder, richly as they
deserved it and little as I was inclined to mercy.
I also thought of clapping them in irons and
stowing them below. But there were not irons
enough aboard for that purpose and Mistress
Wilberforce and I could not work the ship unaided;
we could not even feed and water our
prisoners. Yet, if I could have counted on three
or four true men’s assistance, I would have risked
it. So far as I could judge the whole crew had
become thoroughly corrupt. I did not dare to
try any of them. No, to abandon the ship was
our only chance.</p>

<p>How my little mistress had passed the dragging,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
anxious hours of that awful day you can
better imagine than I can describe. And my
occasional visits had scarcely reassured her
greatly. Yet in an emergency I have never
known a woman who had more spirit, who could
bear herself more courageously, and I never want
to be so loyally or efficiently backed by anyone
as she backed me. But I have often observed
that it is the waiting that is hardest. It is the
standing still and not knowing what is going to
turn up, that takes strength out of a strong man
and much more out of a nervous woman.</p>

<p>She had left her noon meal practically untouched,
and was sitting there in the cabin nervously
clutching the pistol, frightened half to
death. Poor girl, I didn’t blame her. Whatever
may have been the cause of it she was genuinely
glad to see me when I came in and lighted
the cabin lanterns.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “I have been in agony the
whole day. Every sound has caused me to seize
this weapon and when I have not been watching
the door I have been on my knees praying for
you and for myself. I do not think I can stand
another day like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Please God, dear lady, you shall not,” I said,
smiling reassuringly at her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Have you a plan?”</p>

<p>“I have. The men are all drunk.”</p>

<p>“I heard them taking the spirits from the rack,
and—”</p>

<p>“I gave them all they wanted, and more,” I
interposed.</p>

<p>“Was that wise?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“A little liquor would have inflamed them, a
great deal stupefies them. They are as helpless
as logs now, and if I had three good men besides
myself I could take the ship. As it is—” I hesitated—“I
am here to serve you. I am going to
leave the ship and take you with me.”</p>

<p>“But how—when?”</p>

<p>For answer I threw open the stern window of
her cabin. On a level with it swung a small
boat, a whaleboat. Now I had taken occasion
during the day to lower that boat little by little,
a few inches at a time and then a few inches at
another time, as I had opportunity to get near
the falls and to manipulate them unobserved, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
sheltered by the trunk cabin, of which all the
men were forward, and I had succeeded in my
purpose without attracting attention, although
the risk had been tremendous. Of course, I
couldn’t lower it clear to the water, but I had
brought it down to the level of the cabin windows.
Its sea lashings were cast off and I had
no doubt, if conditions on deck were as I expected
them to be, I could lower it all the way
later on with impunity.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked, staring out
of the window and into the empty boat.</p>

<p>“I mean that you and I are going to embark
in that boat tonight and leave this ship.”</p>

<p>“But where are we going?”</p>

<p>“There is land not a league and a half under
our lee. It seems to be the most easterly of a
cluster of islands.”</p>

<p>“Is it the island we seek, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” I replied, “if there is such
an island, that it will be one of the cluster. We
are in exactly the latitude and the longitude of
the chart if my calculations are correct.”</p>

<p>“The island was uninhabited when my ancestor
was cast away upon it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Yes,” said I, “but there may be natives there
now, and no savages of the South Seas could be
more cruel and ruthless than the men on this
ship. To be frank with you, I have no doubt
that as soon as they are sure that they have
reached the island and that my services are no
longer necessary to enable them to find the
treasure, they will murder me out of hand.”</p>

<p>“And me?”</p>

<p>“They would not be so merciful to you.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t they want to keep you to take
the ship back?”</p>

<p>“That is an easy matter,” I answered. “All
they would have to do would be to lay a course as
nearly possible due east and they would bring up
on the South American coast, Peru, Chile, somewhere,
it would not make very much difference
where, so long as it was near Spanish settlements.
Then they would divide the treasure, wreck the
ship, and scatter themselves and their gains.
No, my usefulness ends as soon as they determine
that yonder is the island and that the treasure is
there.”</p>

<p>“Let us go,” she said, shuddering.</p>

<p>“I thought you would see it that way,” I replied;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
“the worst the natives can do, if there are
any, is to murder us and I shall always save the
last shot—” I paused, I couldn’t bear to say it.</p>

<p>“For me,” she added softly, laying her little
hand again upon my arm—and how I loved and
prized those little touches, those little evidences
of trust and confidence.</p>

<p>I nodded stupidly, speechless as usual.</p>

<p>“What is your plan?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I want you to dress yourself in your stoutest
clothes with your heaviest shoes, wrap yourself
up in a boat cloak and take with you a few necessaries
for your comfort. I will go and rummage
the lazarette for provisions, and I will see if I
can turn up any more weapons in the captain’s
room. I dare not go to the arms chest. It is
below in the hold anyway, and I can’t waste the
time to hunt it out. We must hurry.”</p>

<p>“Why, you said they were insensible.”</p>

<p>“They carry liquor like a line-of-battle ship
her tops’ls in a storm,” I answered. “They’ll
recover their senses before we know it. I want
as long a start as possible, and indeed I must
hasten now.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” she said. She opened a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
drawer under her berth and drew out a leather
case, which she opened and placed before me.
There were two ivory-handled, silver-mounted
pistols in it. “They belonged to my father,” she
said, “with one of them he—he—” her voice
broke. I nodded. I knew what he had done
with one of them. She rummaged farther and
drew out an exquisite sword, quite unlike my
heavy one, but if I could judge anything about
weapons, of fine temper and strength and with its
hilt studded with diamonds. “This was my
father’s, too,” she said, and I recognized it also.
It was that I had taken from Arcester. I have
worn it many times since in the King’s service,
for we found it on the ship again, after—but I go
ahead of my story!</p>

<p>The pistols were smaller than my huge barkers,
better suited for her hand, and to load them
from the flasks which accompanied them was the
work of a few minutes. I thrust my own heavy
weapons back into my belt. I then buckled her
two pistols around her waist and bade her have
the sword handy also. We might need all these
weapons, though I did not think so.</p>

<p>Then I left her and went out on deck. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
men were in a profound drunken stupor. Pimball
was sound asleep, Glibby was nodding, the
lookout aft could hardly keep himself awake and
the lookout forward was in much the same condition.
The rest of the men were as helpless as
logs, like dead men in fact. I made the circuit
of the ship. Glibby leered at me as I drew
abreast of him.</p>

<p>“Everyth-th-ing a-all-r-right?” he hiccoughed.</p>

<p>“Everything,” I answered shortly, “the old
barque doesn’t need much watching tonight, you
can see.”</p>

<p>The wind had fallen somewhat and the sea was
much calmer.</p>

<p>“W-we w-will g-get a s-s-shot at the s-sun in
the m-m-orning,” he continued, “an’ t-then we
will s-s-see where w-we are.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said I, “in the morning.” I yawned
extravagantly. “I will go and turn in, I think.
If you need me, call me.”</p>

<p>He flung a vile suggestion after me which
made me want to turn and heave him overboard,
but I had to force a laugh as I went below into
the cabin. I saw that in a few moments he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the lookouts forward and aft would be like the
rest.</p>

<p>The lazarette was well provided and I stocked
the boat handsomely, not forgetting compass,
lantern, tinder box, and candles. There was not
much water, but I emptied some bottles of wine
and filled them, although I did not greatly worry
on that account because there would be plenty
of water undoubtedly on the island. The boat
was provided with a mast and sail. I got into
her as she swung at the davits and overhauled
spar and gear. Then I shipped the tiller and
presently everything was ready. A final search
brought to light a narrow locker in the captain’s
room which I forced open, and found to contain
a fine fowling piece, a double-barreled shotgun,
and a heavy musket with plenty of powder and
ball. These I passed into the boat also, with a
sharp and heavy axe.</p>

<p>“Have you got ready all that you wish to
take?” I asked my little mistress when all my
own preparations were completed.</p>

<p>“A change of linen, some toilet articles and
necessaries, needles and thread,” she answered,
holding up her bundle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Good,” said I. I judged it was about ten
o’clock at night. “Now do you get into the
boat, madam.”</p>

<p>She had not been on the ship for six months
without having learned something about it and
she instantly asked me,</p>

<p>“But how are you going to lower the boat
away?”</p>

<p>“I will have to go up on deck for that,” I said.</p>

<p>“But won’t they see you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, but whether they do or not,
we must chance it, but if anything should happen
to me, I’ll manage first to lower and then to
cut the boat adrift and you will be in God’s
hands. I don’t think they will see me and I am
going to do my best to see that nothing does happen,
but always you will have to trust to Him.”</p>

<p>“I do, I do,” she whispered, “and to you.”</p>

<p>There was no irreverence in that, I am sure,
and I bowed my head silently, assisting her to
take her place in the stern sheets. It was not a
large boat, yet she made but a small figure sitting
there. Then I went on deck. I had a can
of oil with me to oil the blocks. It was as I
fancied. By that time everybody on the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
was asleep in a drunken stupor and the bottle I
had passed to the hard-headed Glibby as I had
left him had done its work, too. The two lookouts
were sleeping with the others. The man
forward was sprawled on the deck. I went forward
to make sure. The ship was deserted so
far as human supervision was concerned.</p>

<p>Still, I didn’t neglect any precaution. I oiled
the sheaves of the blocks and lowered the boat
away carefully inch by inch until it was water-borne.
I reassured my mistress by whispered
words as I did so. She had had her instructions,
and right well she followed them. She had her
boat hook out and fended off the minute the boat
touched the water. For me to belay the falls
and slide down the forward one, to cast off and
take my place in the boat was but the work of
an instant. The oars had been carefully
muffled. Although the noise of the waves rendered
conversation quite safe we neither of us
spoke a word until I had rowed some distance
from the ship.</p>

<p>As I pulled away I half regretted that I had
not poured the remainder of the oil down the
fore hatch and set fire to it. But as I said, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
could not bring myself to wholesale murder like
that, for drunk as they were none could have
escaped. No, the only thing I could do was to
leave them, though there came a time when I
regretted my squeamishness and was sorry I had
not made way with them while I had a chance.</p>

<p>We were very silent for the first ten minutes
or so. I think my mistress was saying her prayers,
while I rowed as I had never rowed before.
I could see the stern cabin lights plainly as we
drew away from the ship, although for the rest
she was in total darkness, no other lights showing,
and so soon as we did get far enough away
to render talking advisable I had too much to do
to spend any time in discussion. I had to get
the mast stepped and the sail spread. Fortunately,
the breeze was blowing directly northwestward
and that was the course we wanted to
steer. I suppose it was nearly midnight before
we got everything shipshape, my lady bravely
helping me with her best efforts, and the little
vessel threshed gallantly through the big seas.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down considerably but it
was very different on the dinghy to what it had
been on the ship and my mistress cowered close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
beside me, clinging to my arm with that instinctive
craving for human contact and for
human society which we all feel under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>I had carefully taken my bearings during the
day, and as I had a good compass on the boat I
knew exactly how to steer. Fortunately the
wind held steady. I laid her course so as to
clear the northeast end of the island around
which I intended to swing so as to be hidden
from the ship at daybreak. Of course we would
eventually be pursued, but if I could get a
long start there might be other islands among
which I could choose my refuge. Many things
might turn up of which a bold man might take
advantage. At any rate, I had escaped from
them, and the one I loved sat by my side. The
clouds had gone, overhead the sky sparkled with
tropic stars. We looked to the Southern Cross
and took courage.</p>

<p>We didn’t talk much. I didn’t dare, and, for
a wonder, she had nothing to say. I managed
the boat, even if I do say it myself, with great
skill. I told her after a while that she was safe.
No sound had come from the ship and the lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
in the cabin, which at first we could see dimly,
presently disappeared. Our escape had not
been discovered. I suggested at last that she
should go to sleep. I arranged the boat cloak
and blankets and although she had to be much
persuaded, I finally prevailed upon her to lie
down in the boat, her head by my knees, and
thus we sailed on through the night.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN day broke I hauled aft the sheet
and headed the boat to the southward,
for I had now crossed what I took to be the head
of the island and could run down the other side.
By the time it was fairly dawn I had made
enough southing to place the north end of the
island between ourselves and the ship. My calculations
had been remarkably accurate again.
I had weathered the islands fairly in good time,
and now as the sun rose I steered the boat
directly toward the land, the changed direction
of the morning breeze permitting me to lay the
desired course.</p>

<p>My hopes were high and I felt a kind of exhilaration
at our escape, although I was by no
means inclined to minimize the possibilities of
grave peril we might soon be compelled to meet.
The island was our destination, however, and
for it therefore I determinedly headed my small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
craft with its precious and still peacefully sleeping
cargo. Poor girl, if ever a woman needed
sleep and rest it was she. And her easy slumber
pleased me the more for it bespoke not only
weariness amounting to exhaustion but confidence
and trust—and in me, and I was stirred
to even greater devotion.</p>

<p>I had sailed in nearly all the waters of the
globe, frequented and unfrequented, and I
fancied I had chanced upon most of the odd
things to be seen therein, but I am free to admit
that the island was unlike any I had ever looked
upon. The chart should have prepared me for
it, but it had not. In the first place, like most
Pacific islands, this was enclosed by a barrier
reef over which the waves broke in white caps
as far as I could see. I supposed that somewhere
there would be an opening in the reef
through which we could sail, although the chart,
rather roughly drawn, had showed none. That
an opening should exist was so invariably the
case with all such islands as I had ever known
or read about that I counted upon finding one
here. But I could not see any opening from the
boat as yet. The lagoon enclosed by the barrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
reef seemed to be from a half to three-quarters
of a mile wide.</p>

<p>The strangest part of the whole game was
that the island itself looked like a whitish-gray
wall rising straight up from the lagoon for, I
suppose, from one hundred and fifty feet in the
lowest parts to three hundred feet or more in
the highest. And the wall appeared to be without
a break. It stood up like a solid rampart of
stone, its top covered with greenery.</p>

<p>From where we were situated at just that moment
I couldn’t see on to the end of the island,
although from my inspection of it the day before,
I judged it might be six or eight miles long,
and as I had sailed past it I estimated it was
about the same breadth and nearly circular in
shape.</p>

<p>A long distance away on the other side and
hard to be seen at all from the level of the sea
in the small boat in which we were, lay other
islands, faintly outlined on the far horizon. I
doubt if I could have seen them at all had not
the rising sun smote full upon them. They
were too far away for my purpose, which was to
make a landing as soon as possible and find some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
concealment or, at worst, some practical place of
defense. I therefore paid no attention to them,
not realizing what a part they were to play in
the adventure following.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have threshed about somewhat
when I brought the dinghy to the wind and
changed her course, for presently my little mistress
awoke. She sat up instantly and after the
briefest acknowledgment of my good morning
and the briefest reply to my inquiry as to how
she did, she stared at the land toward which we
were heading in so far as the wind would allow.
It was a bleak, inhospitable looking place, that
gray rough wall, in spite of its infrequent cresting
of verdure, I will admit, and she too found
it so. After she had stared hard at the land, she
cast an anxious glance to leeward, but of course
could make nothing definite of the distant islands
there.</p>

<p>“We have made good our escape from the
ship, since she is not to be seen,” she began.</p>

<p>“For the present, yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that they—”</p>

<p>“They’ll be after us, of course, as soon as the
drink wears off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“And when will that be?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“This afternoon probably, but we’ve nought
to fear from them for hours yet,” I reassured
her.</p>

<p>“Well, Master Hampdon, what do you propose
between whiles?” she said.</p>

<p>“We must get ashore,” said I, “as soon as
possible. By the time their debauch will have
worn off, they will either bring the ship here
or send the boat after us. Afloat we can do
nothing, ashore we may find some concealment
and probably make some defense.”</p>

<p>“It is a forbidding looking shore.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” was my answer, “but any haven is
better than none, and it may prove better than
it promises on a nearer view.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any evidence of human life?”
she asked, nodding in acquiescence to my proposition.</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.</p>

<p>Indeed, not a curl of smoke anywhere betrayed
the presence of mankind. Had it not
been for depressions on the top of the wall here
and there, which were filled with vegetation, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
might have supposed the island to be nothing
but a desolate and arid rock, but this reassured
me. I thought it strange that there was no
mountain or hill rising from beyond the top of
the wall, but I was yet to see how strange the
island was. Indeed, I think there can be no
other like it in the world. For I have inquired
of many mariners and they all confess that they
have seen nothing anywhere that in the least resembles
it. Some, in truth, seem incredulous
to my tale, though I set down naught but what
is true.</p>

<p>But as it was full morning now, I decided that
first of all the creature comforts had to be
thought of. I offered to relinquish the tiller
and prepare something to eat, but Mistress Lucy
took that upon herself. What we had was cold,
but there was plenty of it, and at my urging she
ate heartily. For myself I needed no stimulus
but my raging hunger. I wanted her to be in
fettle for whatever might happen and myself
too, and so we fed well.</p>

<p>We had not much conversation the while, but
I do remember that she did say she had rather
be there alone with me than on the ship, whereat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
my heart bounded, but I had sense enough to say
nothing. Her loneliness and helplessness appealed
to me. I might have been bold under
other circumstances, but not now. She was dependent
upon me and I could not bring myself
to the slightest familiarity, so I only answered
that I would be glad to serve her with my life
and I prayed God that we might come safely out
of the whole business, to which prayer she
sweetly added her own amen.</p>

<p>Well, we coasted along that barrier reef a
good part of the morning until we reached the
other end of the island, and discovered to our
dismay that there was absolutely no opening, no
break in it through which we could make our
way. When we reached the lower end, my lady
was for sailing around on the other side to seek
farther, but this I did not dare. We had heard
nothing from the ship or her boats, and I did not
propose to arouse any pursuit by coming within
possible range of her glasses. I did not know
where the <i>The Rose of Devon</i> lay; for aught I
knew, they might have put her about and she
might be off the south end of the island. It
was better to let sleeping and drunken dogs lie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
I said. After my rather abrupt negative of her
proposition she watched me in silence as with
clouded brow I pondered the situation.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I at last, “there is naught for
us but to try to go over the reef in some fashion.
As I scanned the island yesterday through the
glasses I couldn’t see any opening in the reef
on that side, and although I never saw or heard
of a case like this before, I make no doubt but
what the reef is continuous and there is no access
to the island except over it. And come to
think of it, Sir Philip’s chart showed no opening
either.”</p>

<p>“I recall that the reef completely encircles the
island on the little map,” assented my lady.</p>

<p>“Then we must even pass over it as we can.
I have had some experience in taking a boat
through the surf, and although it is a prodigious
risk I believe I can take this one over. For
one thing, this dinghy is built like a whaleboat;
we may capsize it, but it is practicably unsinkable.
I propose to take a turn of the painter
around your waist. If she goes over you will
not be thrown completely adrift. I am a stout
swimmer and can catch the boat and haul you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
in it or on it, and whatever happens our lives
will be preserved.”</p>

<p>“Will it be so very dangerous?” she asked me.</p>

<p>I could have minimized the danger, of course,
but I thought she was woman enough to hear
the truth. She might have to face even greater
dangers presently and she might as well become
accustomed to the idea sooner or later. So I
reasoned, and therefore I told her.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the danger could possibly
be greater, and yet,” I added, “I think we shall
win through if you will sit perfectly quiet and
trust to me.”</p>

<p>“I will do whatever you tell me,” she said,
with a most becoming and unusual meekness.
“I think—I know—I trust you entirely, Master
Hampdon.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said I quietly, “and now may
God help us.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the tide was making toward the
shore of the island. I selected a spot where the
huge, rolling waves seemed to break more
smoothly than elsewhere, which argued a greater
depth of water over the barrier, less roughness,
and fewer possibilities of being wrecked on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
jagged points of the coral reef. Dousing the
sail, unshipping the tiller and rudder, and pulling
the oars with all my strength, after an unuttered
prayer, I shot the boat directly toward
the spot I had chosen. Just before I reached
it, I threw the oars inboard, seized one of them
which I wished to use as a steering oar and
stepped aft past my lady, who sat a little forward
and well down in the bottom of the boat.
I braced myself in the stern sheets and waited.
We were racing toward that reef with dizzy
speed rising with the uplift of the wave. I had
just time for one sentence.</p>

<p>“If we die,” I shouted, “remember that I have
been your true servant always.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head, her eyes glistening, and
then I turned to the business in hand. A huge
roller overtook us. The little boat rose and rose
and rose with a giddy, furious motion. Suddenly
it began to turn. If it went broadside to
the reef and a wave caught it or one broke over
it, we should be lost; but I had foreseen the danger.
I threw out my oar and with every pound
of strength in arm, leg, and body, I thrust
blindly, desperately against the heave of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>It was an unequal combat, a man against the
Pacific Ocean. I could not have maintained it
for long. Yet the few seconds seemed hours.
The strain was terrific, of all the tasks I ever
attempted that taxed my strength the most—save
one, as you shall see. If the oar broke we
should be lost. It bent and buckled but held
like the good honest piece of English ash that it
was. Sweat poured from me, my heart
throbbed, my pulses beat, my head rang. It
was not in human power to continue. I was
about to give way and let go all when I cast one
glance at my mistress. I saw her pale face, her
bright eyes staring into mine. My strength then
was about gone, but that look of appeal, entreaty,
and confidence nerved me for one last supreme
effort.</p>

<p>There are not many men with as little experience
in that sort of work as I had enjoyed
who could have done what I did, for I held
the boat steady, her bows fairly and squarely
pointed to the reef in spite of the thrust of the
ocean, and I thought triumphantly that I was
going to make it safely in spite of all. I
reckoned without my host, however. The wave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
we were riding broke just as we reached the top.
We sank down into what seemed a valley of
water, the breakers roared in our ears, the spray
fell over us like rain. We sank lower and
lower, there was a sound of grinding along the
keel. We had struck the coral evidently. The
boat stopped a moment, motionless.</p>

<p>Unshipping my oar, I thrust it violently at
the reef. The blade caught in the coral. I
put all my weight against it. The water rose,
the trough of the sea into which we had fallen
suddenly filled. I clenched my teeth and closed
my eyes and thrust again. The boat lifted a
little, moved a little, the keel grating along the
reef. I heard a scream faintly and opened my
eyes. I caught a fleeting glimpse of my lady’s
face, but could give her no attention. I struggled
desperately to drag the oar free. The
coral rock into which I had jammed it held the
blade like a vise. The boat rose and moved
faster. The oar was wrenched from my hands.
The inrushing wave and the moving boat passing
reef together, the great sea finally broke
upon us.</p>

<p>We were over, but the wall of water struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the boat, now broached to, full on the beam.
She was lifted up, whirled over and swept inward.
The mountainous sea struck me on the
back and side, knocking the breath out of me
and fairly hurling me clear of the boat so that
I fell into the boiling water alongside. My
lady had half risen as the boat swung broadside
to the sea and she was also swept into the water.
If she had remained crouched down she would
have fallen under it and probably would have
been killed.</p>

<p>The sea rolling inward swept us toward
shore. It was well that I had taken precaution
to pass the painter about her waist and
tied the lashing securely. For by means of it
she regained the overturned boat and climbing
up clung to its keel in comparative safety for
the moment. I, on the contrary, was driven
landward and away from her. I struggled desperately,
half-dazed, to regain the boat. I
might better have attempted other things, but
to see my shipmate there on the overturned
boat, so drenched and forlorn, maddened me,
and I fought flooding tide and flooding sea to
reach her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>I could not call out, I was too spent and
breathless for that, but I struggled on and on.
Whatever the cause, the wave which had so
nearly undone us was followed by a succession
of the hugest rollers I have ever seen. Usually
the waters inside such reefs as we had passed
are smooth and calm, but on that day they were
scarcely less rough than the ocean. To attempt
to make head against them was vain.</p>

<p>I know now that my lady called to me to
desist, seeing from her more elevated position
on the boat’s keel that we were rapidly being
driven toward a strip of sandy beach. But I
did not hear. I did not become aware of our
nearness to the shore until my foot actually
touched bottom.</p>

<p>The next wave carried me landward and left
me prostrate on the sand. I scrambled to my
feet and leaped to meet the boat, also being rolled
toward the beach.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i190.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“Then she bent over me.”</p>

<p>Mistress Lucy had cast off the lashing and had
let herself into the water, and none too soon,
for the capsized boat, I think her mast catching
on the bottom, was suddenly righted by the
waves, the mast carrying away, and before I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
could avoid it I was struck by the prow and knew
no more.</p>

<p>By this time, as I afterward learned, my brave
shipmate had got to her feet in the shallows.
She saw the boat hurled upon me, saw me
borne backward on the beach, saw me carried
up the sand, and left lying senseless by the spent
wave.</p>

<p>With feelings which she did not attempt to
describe until long after, she ran to me, and
with a strength, the source of which she could
not explain, dragged me further up the beach.
I am a large man and with all my inertness and
the weight of my sodden clothes, I know not how
she compassed it.</p>

<p>Then she bent over me. I did not ask her
what she said or did until she chose to tell me
later of her own will, but I presently awoke
to find her looking into my face, holding my
shoulders with her hands and frantically calling
me by name.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon! Master Hampdon!”—her
voice rose into a scream of terror.</p>

<p>“Fair and softly, my lady,” I answered slowly,
sitting up and looking about me. “I am dizzy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
my head aches from the blow, but I believe
there are no bones broken. Let me see,” I continued,
rising and steadying myself by a great effort
by the boat, which luckily enough lay
quietly on an even keel bedded in the sand near
by, and unhurt save for the broken mast. “And
you, dear lady?” I asked as soon as I could command
myself.</p>

<p>“Safe, safe, thank God and you!” she cried
tremulously.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said I, trembling from the violence of
my efforts at control, “give to Him alone the
glory.”</p>

<p>But she shook her head. I reached down my
hand toward her and lifted her up and for the
first time got sight of her. She had worn a
dress of some silken stuff, over a petticoat, or
skirt, of darker, heavier, woolen cloth. Her
overdress had been torn to rags by the sea.
There was a great rip in her underskirt, which
she caught on a nail or splinter when she slid
from the boat into the water. Both her
buckled shoes were gone and one stocking had
been stripped from her by the seas. Her little
bare foot gleamed whitely on the golden sands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Her hair was undone, water dripping from her
sodden raiment.</p>

<p>Under my steady inspection she colored violently
and instinctively sought to conceal that
bare foot beneath her tattered clothing. She
hath protested often since as to how she must
have looked, but to me then as ever, she was
beautiful in her disarray and disorder and as
to her sweet, white foot I longed to kiss it; aye,
and take no shame to myself in this confession,
either. And I have done so since, not once but
many times.</p>

<p>Obviously the first thing was to provide her
with clothes. She had her other apparel in a
little chest which I had lashed to the thwarts,
but when I searched for it in the boat it was
gone, and the thwart too. The weight of it and
the final buffeting had wrenched both clear. In
fact, the boat was swept clean save for the
weapons, which I had thrust under the thwarts
and lashed there, and the contents of the lockers.
Even the sail had been dragged clear of the
boom which still clung to the foot of the broken
mast.</p>

<p>The sea had gone down a little and as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
stared out across the lagoon I caught sight of
the sail. Fortunately it had got foul of the
broken thwart, which had been wrenched loose
by the drag of the box that had been lost, and
it was still afloat. It was a light canvas. It
flashed into my mind that it would do. Without
a word I plunged into the lagoon and a few
strokes brought me to it. I dragged it ashore
and spread it in the sun before the inquiring
gaze of my shipmate.</p>

<p>“What is that for, a tent?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Your clothes,” said I. “The first thing for
me to do is to turn cobbler and tailor. You
couldn’t go about, like a South Sea islander, bare
armed and barefooted,” I continued calmly.
“Out of the sailcloth we can make you some sort
of a dress.”</p>

<p>“But my shoes and stockings,” she said facing
me bravely, although the color came and
went at the untoward situation for a modest
maiden.</p>

<p>“I can manage the shoes,” said I, “but the
stockings—” I paused. “When we have made
the dress,” I continued “you won’t need that red
skirt and you can make shift to slit it into lengths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
and wrap them about your legs. They will protect
you better than what you have lost.”</p>

<p>Fortunately I brought along with me a sailor’s
needle and palm with stout thread aplenty
still safe with other contents of the lockers. It
was intensely hot in the sun and it did not take
the canvas spread out upon the sand long to
dry. Picking it up we moved inward across
the narrow strip of beach to the cool shadow of
the cliff. There was much to be done, but
clothes and footgear for her had to be attended
to first of all. And as we had seen no one, we
went about making them with energy and a good
heart.</p>

<p>Here my little mistress could help. I am as
good a tailor, I dare say, as any man that sails the
seas, but feminine rigging had never been my
experience or endeavor. Between us, with the
aid of my sheath knife, which I ever kept sharp,
we managed to cut out a plain loose dress like a
tunic. Fortunately, she being but a small
woman and understanding how to use all the
goods to the best advantage without wasting any,
we were able to get out a suitable garment which
fell below her knees halfway to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>While she was busy cutting it I had taken off
my vest or jerkin of stout leather, and with
her remaining shoe as a model for shape and
size, I contrived the sort of a foot covering that
the savages of North America call a moccasin.
It was shapely enough too, and I made the soles
of several thicknesses of leather, and protected
the heel and toe by additional strips. So I
managed to knock together a very serviceable
pair of loose shoes. By the time I had finished
them my lady had got her pieces laid out, and
the sewing of them devolved upon me, for she
could by no means with her small hands manage
the rough cloth and large needle. I worked
hard and before noon I had the garment fit for
her to wear.</p>

<p>My mistress then retired behind the protecting
rock and donned the tunic. She had taken
my sheath knife with her and had made herself
some kind of a girdle which she had cut from
her now useless skirt. She had put on the shoes,
and with further strips from the cloth had replaced
the stocking that she had lost, and the
other one also. She must have seen the admiration
in my eyes as she came rather timidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
forward to my gaze. I suppose she had some
doubts as to her appearance, but my tailoring
and cobbling became her vastly, I avowed.
The canvas was new and white, the scarlet about
her waist, even the brown leather of my moccasins
with the red above, added a charming
touch.</p>

<p>From a woman of the world and society she
became in one hour, it would seem, a creature
of simplicity, like the ancient Romans of whom
I had read. She still possesses that garment
and those shoes, and sometimes in the privacy
of her chamber she dons them for me. The
sight brings back old days and brave days of
hard fighting and true comradeship and great
adventure on that far-off island set in that tropic
sea under those blue skies. And I love her
better than when in the diamonds and powder
and silk and brilliant array with which nowadays
beauty obscures itself under the demand of
fashion.</p>

<span class="small">HOW WE EXPLORE THE WONDROUS SHORE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THANKS to you, Master Hampdon,” she
began, reassured by my glance, “I am
now clothed and shod comfortably and in my
right mind.”</p>

<p>“You are always in that, Mistress,” said I
quickly.</p>

<p>“You did not think so in the cabin of the ship,”
she laughed, and giving me no time to answer,
for I am not quick at speech on some occasions,
as you who read must have noticed, she ran on,
pointing to the barrier reef as she spoke, and
staring at the breakers smashing against it, “but
shoemaking and dressmaking are small things
after what you did out there.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing,” said I.</p>

<p>“I watched you. I was not too frightened to
do that, and there is not another man on earth
who could have brought me over the fearful
maelstrom of water to safety here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Well, that is true, why not admit it? I
thought.</p>

<p>“Not many white men,” I replied, glad for
her praise, “but natives in their canoes aplenty.”</p>

<p>“But a canoe is light and easily managed, not
like this heavy boat.”</p>

<p>“No, I admit there is a difference”—as indeed
there was—“but now we must think on the
future,” I added.</p>

<p>“And what is to be done next?” she asked.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done, I decided, was to
overhaul the boat. I pulled the plug out,
drained the water from her, hauled her up on
the sand above high water mark, my lady helping
me as if she had been a man. I remonstrated
with her about it, I begged her not to
do it, finally I even ventured on a command to
which she paid not the least heed.</p>

<p>The precious powder and shot we found dry
and safe in the flasks in the air-tight lockers.
From the same safe place, we got some hard
bread, some cold salt beef, and with water from
a brook that gushed out from under the rocky
wall and ran across the beach we broke our
fast again on this plain rough fare. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
yet near noon, but we had gone through much
since that early breakfast, and were healthily
hungry again—and so we made our meal. Dry,
hard eating to be sure, but we were thankful to
God that we had it.</p>

<p>Finishing, and feeling much refreshed, we decided
that our first duty was to explore the
island to see if there was any break in the cliff
wall, and if there was any access to the inward
parts in which I hoped to find vegetation, trees,
and the delicious fruits with which I knew the
tropics abounded. My lady was heartily in
favor of such a course, and we at once set about
carrying it out.</p>

<p>A hasty survey assured me that the cliff was
of coral formation, jagged and broken into many
a crevice and cranny. If we were hard put to
it, I was sure we could find a cave in which to
pass the night if it were necessary. After we
had made out what we could, I suggested to
Mistress Lucy that we start at once exploring,
proposing that we follow the course of the sandy
strip and find out what we could of our island
refuge. And, so, taking with us some provisions,
for we might have to go clear round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the island, and our arms, we presently started
out. My mistress professed herself well rested
and ready for anything. My own endurance
was not yet at its limit, and I felt the necessity
of discovering the lay of the land at once, in
view of the presence of Pimball and the ship in
those waters.</p>

<p>Yet I felt very easy in my mind regarding any
present peril from the ship, for I knew that no
boat she possessed could run the reef as I had
done, and even if she had had another like the
dinghy I was confident that there was no man
aboard her that had the strength and skill, to
say nothing of the courage, to bring her through.
Indeed, for all my skill and ability we ourselves
had only got through by the favor of God. If
there were no natives or wild animals to be
feared we were at least safe for the time being.
I explained this to my companion as we trudged
along the hard, white sand, whereat she was
greatly relieved and her quick mind being freed
of apprehension turned to other things.</p>

<p>“Think you, Master Hampdon,” she said,
“this is the island of which my ancestor wrote?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“He referred to it, if I remember right as ‘<i>Ye
Islande of ye Staires</i>,’ did he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was my answer. “You remember he
indicated a stairway about the middle of the
island.”</p>

<p>“Surely, if we are to get to the top of yonder
wall it must be by stairs of some sort.”</p>

<p>“It would not be difficult to climb it,” I assented,
“for a man, that is, save for one thing.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“Those pinnacles of rock are as sharp as
needles. It would be like climbing broken
glass. The climber would be cut to pieces before
he had gone halfway. See,” we approached
the wall closely and I pointed out to
her how sharp the edges were. “If it were
granite rock these ridges and splinters would be
weatherworn and smooth, but this coral formation
is of a different quality.”</p>

<p>“Then if we find no stairs we are in a bad
situation,” she said thoughtfully, examining the
towering wall.</p>

<p>“There must be stairs,” I answered, “or there
must be some other way. The latitude and
longitude agree with your ancestor’s description,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and I make no doubt we shall chance upon
them.”</p>

<p>“But if there are none?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“Doubtless we’ll find some break to let us up
or in,” I answered easily, evasively it may be, but
hopefully, not being minded to pass our existence
on the narrow strip of sand on which we
were walking.</p>

<p>So we tramped along, searching the shore and
sea and finding nothing. After perhaps an
hour’s monotonous going, when we had traversed
about a third of the distance of the island, we
rounded a projection of the cliff and there before
us—rose the stairs!</p>

<p>Now I know that you who read will accuse
me of fond invention, yet I have not the wit or
the imagination of the romancer. I can only
relate the facts as they were. What we saw was
a gigantic stairway, irregular, but made of huge
blocks of roughhewn stone—not coral rock, but
harder stone of firmer texture, like granite almost.
I was not familiar with the stone either.
There was no symmetry about the stairs. Some
of the stones rose perhaps three feet, and others
not more than as many inches, but stairs they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
certainly were, and they surely had been made
by man. The stones were most carefully fitted,
being laid up without mortar, the joints so close
that I could scarce thrust a knife blade between.
The huge blocks were of monstrous size, too;
much too great in bulk and weight to be handled
by any but mechanical means. I never could
conceive how natives or primitive men could
have shaped them, moved them, and finally laid
them up in the form of stairs. I have since
made inquiries of learned men and find that for
all their study they, too, are at sea as to who
were those mighty builders and how they
builded.</p>

<p>Nor did the stairs alone awaken our amazement
and quicken our curiosity. They ended in
the circling belt of sand, here a little wider than
elsewhere. At the bottom on either side, two
gigantic statues, or busts, of stone had been
erected. Their bases were buried in the sand
and they rose to quite twice my height above,
and I am good six feet tall and more. These
stones were carved into the rough yet not unreal
likenesses of human faces. The carving had
been done with marvelous skill considering, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the faces were not of the native type either.
They were of our type, only distorted and exaggerated.
The carving included the breast; one
was a man, the other a woman. They were
made of the same hard pinkish rock as the stairs,
and the angles and projections upon them apparently
had been softened and smoothed by hundreds
of years of exposure to the weather.
They were not unfamiliar to us either, for they
were, making due allowance for size, just like
the little image Sir Philip had brought back.
They had the same enormous sightless eyes, the
same long protruding jaws, the same hideous
fang-like teeth, the same repulsive features.
We looked at them both, experiencing a perfectly
natural and understandable feeling of
horror and disgust. One had lost his crown,
but the other was intact as he had left the
carver’s hands.</p>

<p>The very size of them intensified our disquiet.
They were caricatures of course, but withal they
were intensely natural and lifelike and not less
wonderful than the stairs, over which for centuries
they had been the silent watchers and
guardians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Certain I am that you will find it difficult to
credit these marvels, and will dismiss them perhaps
as a traveler’s idle tale, yet I have given
you the latitude and longitude of the island and
you may go there and see them for yourself if
you desire, and you may perhaps find what
treasure we left there, too, for a reward! When
you return you can testify that I lie not, but speak
the sober truth.</p>

<p>Why we had not discovered these stairs from
seaward was because they did not come squarely
down to the water’s edge at right angles to the
wall, but instead lay, as it were, parallel to it
in a niche within the wall, so that they were
somewhat sheltered from observation from the
sea.</p>

<p>As we broke upon them suddenly, therefore,
Mistress Lucy clutched my arm. We naturally
drew together at the sight of such gods, or devils,
in stone.</p>

<p>“The giant stairway!” she cried in thrilled
amazement.</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” I said triumphantly, as I realized
what our discovery meant, “just as it was
stated in the parchment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“And the great stone faces,” she added in a
voice in which there was a note of horror.</p>

<p>“They, too, were mentioned, you remember,”
I said, striving to speak cheerfully, though I
was deeply impressed myself.</p>

<p>“And just like the little one back in the ship.”</p>

<p>“The very same,” was my reply.</p>

<p>“They were very old two hundred years ago,”
she commented.</p>

<p>“Aye, it appears to me that they must have
been old a thousand years ago, or more,” I
assented.</p>

<p>“Could those stairs have just happened that
way? Or did someone build them, think you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “those are the work of men,
skilled men, too, for they are too regularly laid
up to be by chance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, and the images could never
have come there by chance,” she admitted.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, but let us go nearer and ascend
them,” I said, taking her hand and leading the
way, and she was so preoccupied that she did
not notice.</p>

<p>I observed, as we approached the stairs that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the rock had been worn smooth by the wind and
weather, or maybe by the passing of many feet,
and the steps were quite practicable for ascent.
The angle at which they rose was sharp, too.</p>

<p>“What is on top, think you?”</p>

<p>“I know not.”</p>

<p>“Wild men or savage beasts?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“The parchment said naught of animals or
permanent inhabitants of this island,” I reassured
her.</p>

<p>“No, that it did not,” she assented.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s chance it.”</p>

<p>I had thrust the pistols in my belt, save for the
one she carried, and had the musket in my hand.
I looked to the priming of them so that I could
depend upon them in case of an emergency, although
I confess I did not expect anything to
happen. Save for the sound of the wind and
waves and our own voices the place was pervaded
by that sort of deadly stillness which indicated
the absence of humanity, or even the larger
forms of animal life. Except for the birds of
gorgeous plumage and the gulls and other sea
fliers I believed we were absolutely alone on the
island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Then we began the ascent. It was easy
enough for me, but hard for her, and several
times I made bold to lift her up the higher
steps, which she suffered without comment or
resistance. She told me long afterward that my
manner toward her then and thereafter had been
perfect. I had determined in my heart to show
her that although I could snatch a kiss on the
quarter-deck of a crowded ship, on an island,
alone, I could treat her with all the courtesy and
consideration of the very finest gentleman of her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>When we at last reached the top, before us lay
a broad pathway rudely paved with the same
hard stone. This road led straight across the
top of the wall toward the interior of the island,
of which we could see as yet nothing, because
the wall hereabouts was covered with dense,
luxurious vegetation and seemed of great thickness,
perhaps a mile or more, as we found as we
traversed the way. Progress was difficult even
in the pathway. It would have been impossible
in some places but for my heavy cutlass with
which I cut a path where the place had become
overgrown by trees and bushes which had forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
their way through the cracks, overturning and
breaking the heavy flagstones and blocking up
the path, which, it was evident, had not been
traversed for generations; perhaps not since the
old buccaneer himself had walked along it beneath
the spreading trees.</p>

<p>There was naught for it but to continue along
the rude paved way, for it was impossible to
penetrate the jungle on either side, even if we
had desired it, and once more looking to my
weapons, one of which I kept in hand, although
I was sure now we should not need them, and
had indeed nothing to fear, we followed the
ancient way. For perhaps a mile we pursued
our journey across the top of the wall, winding
in and out among the trees, through the jungle,
the path evidently seeking the most level direction,
for the top of the wall was very much
broken and irregular.</p>

<p>At last we came to an open spot on the inner
edge overlooking the whole island, and before
us lay such a picture as few eyes, at least of our
race, had ever looked upon. The wall ended
abruptly and fell downward, on the inner or
landward side, as precipitously as it rose outwardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and to seaward. Before us lay a most
entrancing valley, perhaps three or four miles
across, and maybe half as long again in the other
direction, and which was walled about in every
direction. It was sunk beneath this wall crest
for perhaps one hundred feet or more. In the
center of the valley the land rose a little higher
than the island wall, making a very considerable
hill, tree crowned on the slopes, but largely bare
save for more images, on the crest. Through the
valley ran a brook which ended in a little lake,
which I suspected had some subterranean connection
with the ocean. As far as we could see,
and the whole circuit of the island was now
clearly visible to us, the enclosing wall was
unbroken. The valley was filled with clusters
of trees and alternating stretches of grassy
meadow. Why it was not completely overgrown
with trees I could not imagine. Perhaps
the ground was too shallow in places for trees
to grow.</p>

<p>We would have been hard put to it to descend
the wall to the valley, but for the fact that the
same people who built the stairs that gave access
to the wall from the sea had also built a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
flight which made the descent to the valley possible,
indeed easy. Before we essayed the
descent of the stairs, we drank our fill of the
beauty and mysterious charm of it all. Indeed,
there was no sound that came to us except the
twittering of the birds, of which there were many
brilliantly plumaged flitting in the trees. All
else was still, lonely, deserted, oppressively so
in fact.</p>

<p>I was constrained to think of our situation as
we scanned the lonely prospect in silence. A
man and a maid cast away upon an absolutely
deserted island rising from the most unknown
and unfrequented seas on the globe, seemingly
with no chance on earth of escape therefrom.
The one possibility of getting away, <i>The Rose
of Devon</i>, worse than useless to us because of her
evil crew. What were we to do? What could
we expect? Suppose we found the treasure, of
what value would it be to us?</p>

<p>I cursed myself for my weakness in allowing
my lady to come upon this voyage of death and
disaster. I wished that I had destroyed Sir
Geoffrey’s letter. And yet as my glance fell
upon her my thoughts changed. A man and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
maid, I have said. Distinctions of rank did not
exist in the Garden of Eden. This was the
world’s first morning again, and by my side,
dependent utterly upon me, stood—Eve! My
heart beat, my face flamed at the thought.
Here, if nowhere else, she might—</p>

<p>“What think you of this?” my lady broke the
silence, and she broke more than the silence, for
her words recalled me to my better sense again.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” I answered, shamed in my
soul at my imaginings.</p>

<p>“Is it not like the crater of an ancient extinct
volcano?” she ventured.</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “these are coral rocks and there
is no sign of lava about them, yet it has somewhat
of the appearance, especially that flattened
hillock in the center.”</p>

<p>I have since talked with many men and
studied the writings of the most learned geologists,
and from what I have been able to glean
from them, and the suggestions I have been able
to give, it has been fancied that perhaps the
rocky projection in the middle of the valley,
where later on we saw the great altar of sacrifice
with its attendant idols, was the original island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
which was once surrounded by a coral reef now
become a wall, and that some great upheaval
had lifted the whole up out of the water in ages
gone by, and that the barrier reef over which we
had passed was the second attempt of the busy
little insects to surround the island again. And
indeed, though I know but little about such
things, the theory may well be true, although it
gives no solution of stairs or images or altars.
It seems easier to explain nature than man, you
see. But these things, naturally, did not occur
to us then.</p>

<p>“What is to be done now?” asked my little
mistress.</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” I answered, staring at the
green cup of the island, encircled by the white
walls, like a great emerald wreathed in pearls.
I should not have thought of that comparison,
myself, but it occurred to my lady later, and she
told me, so I have put it in to embellish this
rather dry narrative of mine. “I see no signs
of human life or of animals, except birds,” I
continued, “I firmly believe that we are absolutely
alone on the island.”</p>

<p>Involuntarily, I looked at her as I spoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
whereat she came instantly toward me without
hesitation.</p>

<p>“We are alone,” she said, as if divining my
thought, “and I am in your power. I am weak
and you are strong, but—”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, with all the formality I
could infuse in voice and bearing, “you are as
safe with me as if you were in your late father’s
arms, and surrounded by all the people you
love.”</p>

<p>“I know it and I trust you,” she answered.
“Indeed, indeed, Master Hampdon, I am glad
to be here, to be away from that awful ship of
death and I believe this is the island which we
have been seeking. Where else in the world is
there such a wall and such a flight of stairs? I
am sure the treasure will be here and when we
search for it we shall find it.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” I answered, “but what is exercising
me most now is, first of all, what is going
on in that same mutinous ship, and next how we
shall finally get away from here.”</p>

<p>“You are impatient,” returned my lady,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Impatient for you, madam,” I interrupted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
checking myself from further self-revealing
speech just in time.</p>

<p>“One thing at a time,” she continued. “By
the favor of God, we have escaped from the
murderers and mutineers and by His providence
we have come safe across the reef. We shall not
starve upon this island, and I have no doubt
that sooner or later you will devise some means
for our escape. You have done so well so far
that I feel quite confident; in fact, if Captain
Matthews were with us, I should feel almost
happy.”</p>

<p>This was rating my power very highly I
knew, and I felt that I might not be able to
justify her confidence, but if I failed it would
not be for lack of trying. It was long past noon
by this time. I made sure of it by looking at
the sun and confirming it by my watch which I
most carefully kept running during all our
sojourn on the island, which indicated close on
six bells, three o’clock. Our talk of the ship
recalled me to myself.</p>

<p>“I think,” said I, “that we had better postpone
the exploration of the island until another
day, and go back to our landing place. If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
know the men on that ship they will guess that
we have escaped to this island, and they will
bring her round to this side, where we may have
them under view and they us. And I shall feel
safer and more confident and comfortable in my
mind about your future if my present doubts
as to her whereabouts be settled.”</p>

<p>“Think you that they can come at us?” she
asked, in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“I think not,” I answered confidently, “but
still, to make sure, I should like to have them
under observation.”</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short, we retraced
our steps over the broken path until we reached
the stairs on the other side. The descent of
them was much easier than the ascent, and by
four of the clock we stepped on the sand again.
There before us in the offing was the ship.</p>

<p>We saw her people quite plainly and I doubt
not they caught sight of us immediately also.
They were scarcely a third of a mile away from
the reef, perilously near, I thought, and we
could mark them crowding the rail and staring
landward. We could see them brandishing
their weapons and we could imagine the yells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
which must have arisen from the decks when
they caught sight of us.</p>

<p>I stared at them indifferently enough, but not
so my little mistress. She shrank closer to me,
her face paled and I had all I could do to keep
from throwing my arm about her shoulders. I
blessed God that she was here on the island and
that I was by her side, and that neither of us
was on the deck of the ship.</p>

<span class="small">INSIDE THE REEF WHICH WAS AT ONCE
PROTECTION AND PRISON</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE ruffians aboard the ship did not content
themselves with simply staring at us,
for presently they assembled on the port quarter,
the ship was under all plain sail on the starboard
tack at the time, the wind having fallen
to a gentle breeze during the day, and clambered
into the cutter swinging at the davits. As
she was lowered into the water fully manned,
Mistress Lucy drew even closer to my side, seizing
my arm with both hands.</p>

<p>“Let us fly, they are coming to take us!” she
cried in great alarm.</p>

<p>“But they are on a vain errand,” I reassured
her calmly.</p>

<p>“But why? How can you know that? Oh,
Master Hampdon, let us hasten away.”</p>

<p>“We have a protector,” I answered confidently
enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“God?” asked she.</p>

<p>“His handiwork,” I replied, as I indicated
with a gesture the barrier reef over which the
waves were breaking.</p>

<p>“But we passed it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in a light dinghy and you remember
the difficulty and danger. They will never surmount
it in that heavy cutter. They will not
even attempt it, when they have seen it nearer,
trust me.”</p>

<p>“But if there should be an opening?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is one,” was my reassuring
reply. “We know that there is not one
on this side, since we examined it ourselves, and
my careful inspection yesterday did not reveal
any on the other, and with that conclusion the
chart agrees, you remember. No, I have no
fear that the crew of <i>The Rose of Devon</i> can get
at us.”</p>

<p>“And we can’t get to them,” she answered
more composedly.</p>

<p>“I have no wish so to do,” I laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me,” she persisted,
“what keeps them out, keeps us in.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted, “that is true, but for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
present I don’t mind being kept in, so long as
they are kept out.”</p>

<p>She looked at me quickly and confessed afterward
that my words begot some quick suspicion
which she admitted was unworthy of her and
unwarranted by any act of mine, but I looked so
placid that it soon passed from her mind. As
a matter of fact, I had not appreciated the significance
of my words. I should have been perfectly
willing, I should be still, to pass the rest
of my life alone on that island, or anywhere else
with my lady only. She was company enough
for me and although we have ruffled it bravely
together since then, and have even borne our
part with dignity at the King’s court, I am happiest
when she is by my side and no one else is
near. I was happy then. I had got her to myself;
my little mistress must look to me for everything.
The haughty queen of the quarter-deck
was now the humble dependent of the lonely
island.</p>

<p>I did not know what dangers lay before us,
what perils encompassed us. I could not foresee
how we were to escape from the Island of the
Stairs, for so we had named it. Those thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
did not trouble me much. I had brought her
safely from a ship filled with mutineers, pirates,
and murderers; I had landed her safely on the
island despite circling reefs and raging seas; the
future could take care of itself. Sufficient unto
the day was the evil thereof—aye, and the good,
too!</p>

<p>We trudged along the sand parallel to the
course of the boat which was following the outward
edge of the barrier reef seeking what I
knew they would not find, an entrance to the
lagoon and thence to the island. The lagoon
narrowed in places, until, had it not been for the
roar of the waves on the barrier reef, a hail could
easily have carried. I am ashamed to say that
I used insulting gestures on occasion, whereat
some of them stood up in the boat and shook
their fists in our direction.</p>

<p>I shall confess to having taken much delight in
irritating them until Mistress Lucy implored
me to cease. Thereafter we watched them in
grim silence and contempt. Although I was
sure they could not reach us, their presence was
nevertheless a menace and a barrier to us. After
they had rowed the length of the island they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
gave it up and went back to the ship, which had
followed their course.</p>

<p>By this time the day was far spent and night
was at hand. We retraced our steps and came
to the place where I had hauled up the dinghy.
I now observed with some pride that both the
shoes and the dress I had made for my lady
would serve their purpose. Meanwhile we
both were hungry. The provisions we had
taken with us we had eaten during the journey.
The next business was supper. I had noticed
some cocoanut trees and other strange tropical
fruits, so I had no fear of starvation. We could
live on the island indefinitely, therefore I was
not sparing with the provisions. Feeling need
of something warming we kindled a fire with
flint, steel, and tinder from their case in the
locker, and made shift to boil some coffee. We
had neither milk nor sugar, but the taste of civilization
did us good, and our refreshment added
to our encouragement.</p>

<p>For the night I capsized the boat and drew it
close against the coral wall, spread a spare sail
I found in the after locker and her boat cloak
which had drifted ashore and dried out during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the afternoon, upon the clean, dry sand, and bade
her take her rest. It was snug, dry and comfortable.</p>

<p>“But you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I shall do very well here with my heavy
jacket and I shall lie across the stern of the boat,
between it and the cliff, out of sight but within
touch or call if you need me.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Nothing can come to you except over my
body and I am a light sleeper. A touch, a word
will arouse me,” I said reassuringly.</p>

<p>“I would not have you harmed, either,” she
persisted.</p>

<p>“I shall not be.”</p>

<p>“There may be wild beasts.”</p>

<p>“I do not think there is an animal on this
island,” I laughed, “and we have seen no signs
of man. The ship certainly would have attracted
the attention of someone had not the
island been deserted.”</p>

<p>“But those men out there?”</p>

<p>“You forget the rampart that God has flung
about us. Now, madam, you can go to sleep
in safety, I assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Before that,” she said, dropping down on
her knees in the sand and motioning me to follow
her example, which I did awkwardly enough—I
hope I was not a mocker or disbeliever, but I
confess that I did not often bend the knee then—“we
will have a prayer together.”</p>

<p>She had slipped a little prayer book within
her bodice and she now drew it forth from her
canvas tunic and by the light of the fire read
the Psalm of David which begins, “<i>Out of the
deep have I called unto thee, O Lord, Lord hear
my voice</i>.” And then she prayed, using some
of the old collects of the Church and adding one
of her own making, in which she besought God
to care for us further, while she thanked Him
for having raised up a defense for her in my
poor presence, I listening very humbly and saying
a heart-felt “Amen” at the end.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that scene; the gray cliff
towering high above us, its crest lost in the darkness,
the overturned boat, the white-clad woman
kneeling by the fire, its light playing upon her
until her face looked like the face of an angel,
myself further back in the shadow. It was a
dark, moonless night but the stars shone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
tropical brilliance and in our ears echoed and
reëchoed the crash of the mighty waves upon
the barrier which was at once our prison and
our fortress. There was a silence for a little
space when she had finished and in that silence
I devoted myself before God to her service
again, and then we rose and she gave me her
hand.</p>

<p>“You have been a true knight and gentleman,”
she said softly, her eyes shining, “and I
thank you.”</p>

<p>I could only take it dumbly and stare at her,
whereat she smiled brightly, although her eyes
suddenly filled with tears.</p>

<p>“And now,” she added, “God keep you.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>I then kissed her extended hand, which she
suffered without resistance.</p>

<p>“I will leave you for a little space,” said I,
“and so good-night and God bless you, too.”</p>

<p>When I came back she was snug in her place
under the boat. I sat for a long time before the
fire, thinking and making plans for our escape.
The ship did not give me much concern because
I was sure she could not come at us, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
end she must go away and leave us alone with
the treasure, maddening as that might be.</p>

<p>It was a strange fortune that had brought us
here. How mysteriously things had worked
out. The marriage of her father and mother,
the last representatives of the two lines that had
come from the same ancestor but had been separated
for a hundred and fifty years, which had
brought together again the old story of the
island, which had been handed down from
father to son, and now to only daughter, during
those many years, with the tradition explaining
it; the indifference with which her father, Sir
Geoffrey, had received it, his leaving the parchment
and the image to her after his death, the
discovery that her mother years before had given
her the other part of the chart; the saving of the
two thousand pounds by worthy Master Ficklin
from the great estate which had been dissipated
by her father; my own opportune appearance on
the scene—I had returned from an American
voyage a short time before his death—her consultation
with me; her determination to take the
money she had and charter a ship; our securing
<i>The Rose of Devon</i>, the enlisting of the crew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and the starting off on this wild goose chase, and
what had happened since—I recalled them all.</p>

<p>At first believing, I had come latterly to scoff
at the whole matter, and had at last laughed to
myself at the prospect of finding an island or
treasure, and had discredited the story of the
old rover buccaneer who had captured the Spanish
treasure ship, his own having been sunk in the
encounter. Now I could reconstruct the whole
scene. He had manned the galleon with his
own crew and they had been wrecked on this
island reef—if this were the island—but the sea
had subsided, and filling the boats with the
treasure they had hidden it in a cave on the other
side of the wall. The sailors had lived there for
some years, but had finally been attacked by
some natives, probably from the islands I could
see dimly on the horizon, and they had all been
killed except Captain Wilberforce, who had
feigned madness and become tabooed.</p>

<p>He had escaped in a canoe from the other
islands, whither he had been carried, and had
fallen in with a Spanish trader, after what voyaging
and suffering who could say? He had
been trans-shipped from one vessel to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
and finally reached his home, a harmless madman
on that subject his friends and neighbors
and even his family thought, with the parchment,
the image, and the tradition which he
bequeathed to his two children after he recovered
his wits before he died. They had quarreled,
married apart, and lost sight of each other.
And here we were, a hundred and fifty years or
more after the death of the old Elizabethan buccaneer,
on his very island. Was the treasure
there still, where the tradition said he had
placed it? We should see. I now believed
that it was.</p>

<p>A long time I sat there until I finally threw
myself down and fell fast asleep. I must have
slept a long time and soundly for I was wearied.
It was she who awakened me. When I opened
my eyes and saw her sweet face bending over me
and heard her dear voice calling me, I declare
I almost felt as if I had died and gone to heaven,
and was being welcomed by an angel. But that
was only for the moment. I realized everything
at once. She herself had but just arisen.</p>

<p>Our first waking thought was for the ship.
She was still there in the offing. She had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
hove to during the night. I could imagine
what fierce debate and wrangling there had been
aboard her. The fact that we had landed would
convince them that the island contained the
treasure for which they had committed murder,
and which they could now by no means come at.
And that we had escaped them, cozened them,
and now could be seen on the beach braving
them, in no way diminished their anger. Even
if there were no treasure, they would be anxious
to get possession of us and wreak their vengeance
upon us.</p>

<p>The day that passed was much like the afternoon
before. Although we were by this time
persuaded that the reef was an absolute protection,
a vague possibility that they could devise
means to pass it in some way, kept us uneasy on
the sand. We must have them under observation.
We were eager to explore the beautiful
vale enclosed by the huge rampart, but we did
not dare to be where we could not watch the
ship. We did walk along the shore and ascend
the giant stairs in the afternoon. Then while
she watched the sea within calling distance of
me, I managed to penetrate the jungle with axe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
in hand, so that finally I made shift to cut down
a cocoa palm tree and we gathered as many
delicious nuts as we could carry and returned to
the shore. And we made plenty of conversation
easily during the hours of watching.</p>

<p>On the ship we had conversed mainly about
business. Now we had no business and my lady
was pleased to look at me in some surprise as I
told her what I guessed about the formation of
the island and displayed unthinkingly the
knowledge of the South Seas and other parts of
the globe which I had acquired in my long
studying and wide cruising.</p>

<p>“Why, Master Hampdon,” she exclaimed,
opening wide her beautiful eyes, after I had explained
to her something of the nature of the
island and how I thought it had been made and
the use of the great quantities of fruits thereof,
“you seem to know more than any of the finest
gentlemen I have ever been thrown with.”</p>

<p>Whereat I was flattered beyond measure and
showed it, but she was kind enough not to rebuke
me for my foolish vanity. And indeed there
were not many—perhaps even none at all—among
her acquaintance who could have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
for her what I had; they were men of spirit, in
truth, but they lacked my experience and my
strength.</p>

<p>That night the sun set amid lowering clouds.
With a sailor’s weather sense, I was sure that we
should have a storm. Pimball and Glibby
sensed it too. We could see them making things
snug alow and aloft on <i>The Rose of Devon</i>.
They were good enough seamen, as far as that
goes. The wind, if it came, would be offshore,
and there would be no danger of the ship being
driven upon our reef, but there were islands to
leeward which they seemed to have forgot but
which I remembered. If it came to blow hard
I would not want to be in the position of <i>The
Rose of Devon</i>, even if I do prefer a ship to the
shore in a storm, but I want plenty of sea room
and that the poor little <i>Rose of Devon</i> had not.
I surmised that the attention of the crew had
been so persistently fixed upon us that they had
scarcely ever glanced to leeward even.</p>

<p>I explained all this to Mistress Wilberforce
as I made things snug for the night. She would
be perfectly protected by the overhang of the
cliff and the overturned boat, and I showed her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
before I left her alone beneath the boat, that the
same overhang of the cliff would protect me
from the wind and the rain if the storm broke.
And so after prayers again and a long look seaward
we went to sleep.</p>

<p>About midnight, so far as I could judge, I
was awakened. The storm broke with all the
suddenness and intensity of the tropics. Such
peals of thunder and such flashes of lightning I
have never witnessed although I had been in
many storms throughout the world. To sleep
further was impossible. Mistress Lucy came
out from her boat and stood beside me as we
leaned against the cliff while the storm drove
harmlessly over our heads.</p>

<p>We could see the ship at intervals by the vivid
flashes of lightning. She was making fearful
weather of it. She was always a wet ship and
the huge waves fairly rolled over her. Once she
went over nearly on her beam ends and I
thought she was gone. I did not view her position
with a great deal of regret, either. Although
she could not come at us, she was a
terrible menace. But the next flash of lightning
showed that her main topmast had gone by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
board, or had been cut away, so she righted.
Presently she drove off before the wind with a
rag of her foretops’l still showing, and that was
the last we were to see of her, we thought.</p>

<p>Praise God, that was not true after all!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<span class="small">IN WHICH WE ENTER THE PLACE OF HORROR</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STORM bound under the lee of the cliffs,
we passed long and anxious hours the next
day, although our only misfortune was in the inclemency
of the weather which kept us close and
prevented our further exploration of the island
and a search for the treasure. We were completely
sheltered and we had plenty of the refreshing
milk of the cocoanut to vary our other
food. Nor did we neglect to improve the rainy
hours by much pleasant converse and by further
work upon my lady’s tunic and shoes. Also I
made her a sort of hat out of palm leaves which
she could tie upon her head by further strips
from that invaluable and seemingly inexhaustible
skirt of hers. And I made myself a head covering
of some of the cloth, letting it fall low over
my neck, as I had observed the Arabs at Aden
do, it being there that the fierce heat of the tropic
sun centers its attack—at least I have heard so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>The second day after it began the tempest
finally blew itself out, although the great surging
seas still broke tremendously over the barrier
reef and the spray shot a score of feet or more
above the crests of the highest waves. It was
only the reflex of the storm, however, for during
the night the wind had subsided into a gentle
breeze. All was calm and peaceful; nature
never looked so bright and smiling, it seemed to
me, as at the dawn of that eventful day.</p>

<p>When we scanned the sea early in the morning
there was of course no sign of the ship. I
imagined that the hazy islands dimly seen in
the bright sunlight on the far-off horizon could
tell a tale of sea disaster if they would. Any
way, I did not believe that we should ever see
<i>The Rose of Devon</i> or her crew again. In both
those beliefs I was mistaken, as you shall find
out, if having read thus far, you have patience to
continue until the end.</p>

<p>Our first inclination, and there was none now
to intimidate us, was to mount the stairs again,
cross over the wall once more and look for that
cave. We had neither chart nor record left,
we had but our memories to trust to, but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
were both agreed that the cave lay in the inner
wall, and that the parchment said it was the
central one of three adjacent openings which
gave entrance to the treasure chamber.</p>

<p>Now I had noticed that the great coral wall,
both on the outer and inner sides, was honeycombed
with openings, rifts, fissures, and caves
which, by the way, were more frequent and
deeper on the inside face; why, I knew not.
We should have been hard put to it to decide
where the cave lay, and should have been compelled
painfully and laboriously to search the
whole face of the cliff in its extent of fifteen miles
or so, but for the further direction of the parchment.
I remembered that, sailorlike, old Sir
Philip had given us a bearing. How did his
words run? Something like this my memory
told me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Toe fynde ye mouthe of ye tresor cave take a bearing
alonge ye southe of ye three Goddes on ye Altar of Skulles
on ye middel hille of ye islande. Where ye line strykes ye
bigge knicke in ye walle with ye talle palmme, his tree, bee
three hoales. Climbe ye stones. Enter ye centre one. Yt
is there.</p>
</div>

<p>Plainly, our first duty was to descend into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
enclosed valley and explore the hillock in the
center. I made no doubt but that we should
find some sort of an altar and more of those
curious and hideous stone images there. If
they still remained, the rest of our task would
be comparatively easy.</p>

<p>With this determination, therefore, we set out.
As I did not know how long our exploration
would require, and as I rather thought we should
have to make a day of it, we started betimes
after a very early breakfast; indeed, as we invariably
retired shortly after sunset, we naturally
rose at break of day. I took along food enough
for the day, knowing that we could get water
from the brooks, and fruit which I judged would
be good for us from the trees.</p>

<p>We went directly to the stairs, mounted them,
and stared about us in amazement. The storm
had been a frightful one. We had not been able
to estimate its power from where we had been
sheltered on the lee side of the island, but here
the uprooted trees and the wide swaths cut in
the jungle on the top of the wall showed its
terrific force. I had no need for my axe. There
were cocoanuts upon the ground and other fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
which would all rot away before we could consume
a hundredth part of it. Within the shelter
of the island cup, as we were presently aware,
less damage had been done, still even there the
ravages of the tempest were widely manifest.</p>

<p>Delaying but little on the top of the wall, we
crossed it rapidly and finally entered the valley.
It was with a feeling of awe that we stood for the
first time fairly within the vast cup at the foot
of the inner stairs, completely shut out from the
world by the great towering rampart of rock
which entirely enclosed us. I had never felt
so far removed from the world as then. Outside,
of course, the limitless ocean ran beyond
the barrier reef, but one could follow it unto the
dim, far-off distance with his vision; within the
cup the glance fell upon the rocky wall on every
hand. It was almost like being in a prison, for
all its tropic loveliness. It was strangely still,
too. There was no wind down where we were.
We could no longer hear the ceaseless splash of
the breakers on the barrier. The calm must
have been like that of the world’s first morning,
when God walked in the garden and saw that it
was fair. We were alone in it too. Ah, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Adam dared not look at this Eve, lest he should
find her all too fair.</p>

<p>Beneath the trees and quite invisible from
above, a paved road or path, barely wide enough
for four to walk abreast, extended straight across
the island to the hillock in the middle, while
smaller paths seemed to follow the course of
the walls on either side. The ground was
gently rolling, and the road, though overgrown
in places and badly broken, was in much better
condition than the broader path on the top of
the wall. I suppose the fact that it was sheltered
protected it. We passed along it for a mile and
a half without much difficulty; as usual, hearing
nothing, except the breeze in the palms and the
birds in the thicket. We went in silence mainly.
We had so far progressed in good comradeship
that talking, unless we had something especial to
say, was not necessary. And the stillness about
us did not move us to speech.</p>

<p>Finally we arrived at the foot of the hillock.
As I observed from the wall, it was grass-grown
and palm tree clad. Indeed we should have
been hard put to it to have ascended it, so dense
was the vegetation, had it not been for the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that the path was continued around the hill constantly
mounting. Where it ran the somewhat
shallow earth had been cut away on the hillside,
and the rocky surface laid bare. Of course,
this path was frightfully overgrown, and rendered
further impassable by the trunks of trees
which had fallen across it; some, from their
freshness, probably cast there by the storm of
the night before. We managed it, however,
and as our identification of the place of the
treasure depended upon our reaching the crest
of the mound, we were compelled to climb it
or give over the search. Leaving most of our
baggage behind, including my coat, for the
day was now hot, we began the ascent.</p>

<p>We went on with the utmost care. I cautioned
my lady that she must on no account move
recklessly. A broken leg or a sprained ankle
would place us at a terrible disadvantage, and be
a most serious hardship, and she must avoid the
possibility at all costs. I assure you I was
equally careful of myself, too. It was intensely
hot under the thick shade of the trees where the
breeze had no chance to penetrate, and I was
sweating mightily when I finally drew my companion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
her face bedewed almost as much as my
own, up the last steep ascent and stood upon the
crest.</p>

<p>We could see now why the top of the hill
had seemed level when we first looked at it from
the wall. Indeed, the coral rock rose in a kind
of sharp, bold escarpment eight or ten feet above
the adjacent tree tops, making a sort of tableland
or platform. This level, probably artificial,
had been paved with the reddish-gray rock of
the stairs and statues, and pathways and trees,
perhaps artificially planted or more probably the
result of Nature’s sowing, grew here and there
in open places in the pavement. I may say
in passing, that in all our exploration of the
island, which however was not very thorough or
complete owing to our limited stay upon it, we
saw no quarry whence this hard, pink rock could
have been taken.</p>

<p>The only satisfactory solution was that it had
been brought there across the seas by the
makers of the monuments and stairs, whoever
they might have been. They must have had
large, seaworthy vessels and adequate means of
land transportation, to say nothing of a most considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
engineering ability to accomplish these
mighty works.</p>

<p>Well, the level top of the hillock was in shape
a parallelogram, in extent perhaps an acre and
a half. It was the most curious place I have
ever seen. In the middle of it, with its four
sides parallel to the sides of the plateau, was a
huge stone platform or altar, perhaps one
hundred feet long by seventy feet wide. Completely
surrounding this altar, some distance
away from it so as to make an aisle perhaps ten
feet in width, rose a line of huge statues carved,
like those at the foot of the stairs, into the semblance
of monstrous and repulsive human faces.
I judged that some of them were at least thirty
feet from mid breast to the top of their crowns.
Not one of them was like another. There was
variation in each just as there is variation in human
faces.</p>

<p>All were ugly and horrible, namelessly evil,
but all were lifelike and were, singularly enough,
European. Yet that a European could have
carved these statues was beyond the wildest possibility.
I have since thought, and others have
thought also, that perhaps the primitive men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
who erected that altar to some unknown god
might have been men of the same racial stock as
ourselves way back in the dim days of the world’s
first morning.</p>

<p>At any rate, these statues or images rose at
the breast from a kind of terrace a foot or so
above the level of the platform, paved as elsewhere.
They formed a sort of cloister or colonnade
around the central platform which rose
twenty or twenty-five feet above. A few of
them had fallen down, but the more part were
standing as their carvers or builders had left
them. On the center of the raised platform or
altar, stood three more of the same monster
busts, placed one after another, the largest one
being in the middle. They were in line, all
looking in the same direction which my pocket
compass told me was somewhat to the north of
northwest by west. They were staring, therefore,
into the general direction of the setting sun.</p>

<p>At the front, or west, end, the great platform
was approached by a flight of steps. The stones
of the pavement were so cunningly fitted together
that only here and there had a seed lodged and
grass-grown, except where the palm trees had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
sprung up, breaking the pavement. The stones
of the platform or altar and the approaching
stairs were also laid up without mortar and fitted
in the same way. How savages with probably
nothing but stone knives could have so perfectly
trued and fitted the surfaces of such huge stones,
to say nothing of moving them at all, was, I confess,
beyond me; but so it was. The altar was
in good repair, indeed so massive was it, and so
well made, that nothing short of an earthquake
could disturb it.</p>

<p>Standing so high, the fierce winds that swept
over the plateau and platforms had probably assisted
in keeping it clear of vegetation, of anything
in fact, for save for the few scattered palm
trees, it was as bare as the palm of my hand.
And indeed, cleaner, for although my lady had
brought with her some soap, I, not knowing how
long we should be on the island and realizing
her dainty habit and what a deprivation it
would be to her to be without it, refrained from
using it and cleaned myself as well as I could
with water and sea sand, a poor substitute for
soap as you can well imagine.</p>

<p>Well, we stood upon the platform and surveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the scene in silent awe. Nothing in the
parchment had led us to suspect all this, although
I recollected the mention of the stone faces looking
toward the niche under the big palm tree,
the spot in the wall by which we were to locate
the treasure cave.</p>

<p>“Come,” said I at last, breaking the silence,
“we will have a nearer look at these gentry.”</p>

<p>“It seems like the temple of a vanished race,”
breathed my lady softly, staring about her in
growing wonder.</p>

<p>“Aye, and of vanished gods,” said I, extending
my hand.</p>

<p>There was something weird and eerie about
the plateau and we felt better for the warm
touch of each other’s hand; at least I did. I
always felt happier when I touched her little
hand, but in this instance the feeling was somewhat
different. In a certain sense it seemed
like profanation for us to be there, yet we went
on steadily, if slowly. We passed by the colonnade
of statues, around the inner platform, and
deliberately mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>Something, I know not what, made me bid
my mistress pause before we reached the top,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and I looked to my pistol, and loosened my
sword in its sheath as I did so, although why I
did so, and what I anticipated, I cannot say. At
any rate, I mounted to the top alone. There
before me lay a platform which was sunk beneath
me for a depth of two feet and which was
surrounded by a low wall on the top of which I
stood. The three images rose from a smaller
platform on a level with the top of this wall in
the midst, and the whole place was filled with
a horrible and frightful mass of human bones.
Skulls, legs, thighs and smaller bones heaped in
terrible confusion lay bleaching before me, and
the space between them was filled with a fine
dust, doubtless the dust of earlier bones which
had moldered away through centuries. Those
that still preserved their shape were the top layer
and were bleached perfectly white. They lay
in all directions as if they had been cast aside
carelessly and at random, yet there were indications
that there had been a path from where I
stood to the platform of the three images, which
platform I perceived was just about wide enough
to lay a human body on it at the base of the
first image.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>I stared apprehensively, I must confess, at this
frightful charnel house of the centuries. The
only evidence of humanity we had discovered
on that island were these bleached and moldering
skeletons. I would have prevented her, but
my mistress suddenly came up and stood by my
side. Then I thought she would have fainted
as the full horror of the scene burst upon her.</p>

<p>“Men have been here,” she faltered, “horrible,
cruel men.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “but centuries ago. Look, the
bones are bleached white. You have naught to
fear.”</p>

<p>“Let us leave this frightful place,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“Presently,” I answered, “but you will remember
the directions of the chart. I must
stand upon yonder altar and get my bearings.
The treasure cave should be in line with the
statues and a niche or depression in the wall on
the further side.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” I said, “will you go down to
the platform out of sight of this horrible place
and wait for me there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“No,” she answered nervously, “Master
Hampdon, wherever you go I must go. I can
never be left alone upon this island.”</p>

<p>I tried gently to dissuade her, but, as usual,
she would have her way so that at last I gave in
perforce.</p>

<p>“Well then,” said I, “at least let me go before.”</p>

<p>I stepped down into the great receptacle
meaning to clear the way with my feet by
kicking aside the layer of bones, and, on my extending
my arm behind me with both her hands
caught in mine, she followed me down into the
enclosure. Of course we had to walk upon the
broken remnants of humanity, but I thrust aside
as well as I could the larger pieces and skulls,
and she, I afterward learned, followed with her
eyes tightly closed, trusting entirely to my guidance.
Indeed she clung to my hand with all
the nervous strength and power she possessed.</p>

<p>So we finally reached the platform. I lifted
her up on it and followed myself. We were not
the first human beings who had been lifted to
that ghastly platform, I was sure, and as I stood
there I could hear in my imagination the protesting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
shrieking, struggling captives about to
be immolated. I could close my eyes and
see the blood dripping down the sides of the
altar, as the breast of the bound victim was
pierced with the stone knife and his beating
heart torn out and lifted up in the face of these
devilish and horrible gods by the terrible priests
of the ghastly sacrifice. It required little effort
to reconstruct the fearful cannibalistic orgies on
the platform below, in honor of whatever awful
deity they worshiped. I did not let myself
dwell upon it, nor did I say anything about it;
and my mistress knew too little about such matters
in her sweetness and innocence and purity
to have such thoughts as mine—thank God!</p>

<p>I led her carefully around the altar platform
therefore, until we could stand at the rear end
by the side of the line of statues and look across
the island. Sure enough, there was the niche or
depression in the wall which Sir Philip had
mentioned, although the “bigge palmme tree”
was gone, or else lost amid hundreds of trees
like it. Beneath it, careful scrutiny showed a
rough pyramid of stone leading up to what
seemed to be openings in the cliff wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>So far every detail in the old buccaneer’s
parchment was absolutely correct. I was certain
now that the treasure was there, and that we
could find it. And a certain exaltation filled me.
At least, we had not come upon a fool’s errand,
though what good the treasure would do us in
our present case after we had found it, I did
not stop to consider.</p>

<p>“See,” I pointed out to my little lady, “following
the edge of the three statues here with your
eyes, the nick or break in the wall of the cliff
is right in line.”</p>

<p>“I see,” she said.</p>

<p>“And below it,” I continued, “for your bright
eyes are perhaps keener than mine which have
looked into the salt seas and over the glare of
water blazing in the sun for so many years, what
can you make out?”</p>

<p>“I see above the tree tops what looks like
a pyramid-shaped heap of stones, the stones of
which Sir Philip spoke, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied excitedly, “and at the top,
at the apex, what?”</p>

<p>“There is a darker opening in the wall between
two others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“The treasure will be there,” said I confidently.</p>

<p>“Let us go to it,” she shuddered, looking about
her. “I don’t wonder that Sir Philip came back
a madman if he lived for long in the presence
of this.”</p>

<p>“We have nothing more to do here,” I
answered, as I led the way to the edge of the
low altar.</p>

<p>I leaped down and then turned to help her.
She was very white and I thought she was going
to faint. I don’t blame her, the surroundings
were so terrible. I acted promptly, reaching up
and taking her in my arms and carrying her as
if she had been a baby; and indeed she was no
great burden for me. Her head dropped to my
shoulder. I did not know whether she had
fainted or not. Her eyes were closed. I ran
swiftly across the enclosure, descended the steps
and without hesitation turned to the edge of
the cliff. I stopped there, cursing myself for
not having brought any water, but as I stopped
she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“You are safe,” said I gently, setting her on
her feet again, “the horrors are all behind us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
See, there is before you naught but the beautiful
greenery of the island, and—”</p>

<p>An expression of gratitude came across her
face.</p>

<p>“Let us go down,” she replied. “We must
never come near here again.”</p>

<p>“Please God, no,” I repeated, as we retraced
our steps down the cliff and along the winding
path, Mistress Lucy gaining strength and color
as we passed at last out of sight of the hideous
platform.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<span class="small">WHEREIN WE FIND THE TREASURE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was necessary to retrace our steps along
the path to the foot of the great stairs in the
island wall. There were treeless meadows here
and there on the way, where we rested, and a
lovely brook of cool, delicious water where we
broke our fast, though it was not yet noon; but
the openings or clearings all stopped before they
reached the foot of the outer wall which was
almost hidden in vegetation. I remembered
the paths which had led off on either side from
the stairs, too. We followed one to the north
easily enough. It was not like the highway
over which we had just come, being only partially
paved, although it had once been
thoroughly cleared, and the rise of the wall was
such that it was still practicable. We turned
to the right, plunged beneath the trees and
pressed resolutely on, keeping as close to the
main wall as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>This wall to our left was dotted with openings
of caves, but none of them seemed to fit the
description we carried in our memories. The
undergrowth deepened and grew denser as we
progressed, and finally I had to open a way with
my axe. The tangled masses soon gave way before
my sturdy energy, and at last we entered a
considerable open space which extended to the
wall. There above us were the three openings
beneath the depression in the crest; surely
enough, the one in the middle being greater than
the others. I deemed that the entrance would
be high enough to admit me, who am much
above the usual stature, without bending my
head. It was elevated halfway up the surface
of the cliff, and the only approach to it was by
the great heap of stones, not laid up with the
order and regularity of the giant stairs, but
apparently piled together haphazard by people
unskilled to make any other practical way of
ascent.</p>

<p>It was difficult enough for us to climb just as
it was. The heap of stones evidently had not
been mounted for years, and the stones had
broken and fallen away in many places. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
we had to rebuild the pile here and there,
which entailed some hours of arduous labor on
my part, in which my lady would participate until
I laughingly threatened to take my belt and
strap her to the nearest tree unless she desisted.
Whereat, smiling strangely, she stopped and, sitting
down near by, watched me at work in
silence.</p>

<p>Reaching the top at last we stood on a shelf
in front of the cave mouth. I peered within but
could see nothing but the blackness. When we
left the ship we had taken a lantern and a few
candles, you remember. I had brought the
lantern with me that day. We now lighted it
with the flint and steel and tinder and stepped
silently in. My lady followed me close, being,
as she had said, unwilling to be left alone, and
ever ready to face any peril in my company.</p>

<p>Above the low entrance the cave wall within
rose to a height of perhaps twenty feet, making
a vast vaulted chamber with Gothic suggestions
about it, for the coral, before it hardened, had
been built into curious shapes and fantastic
figures. We did not notice this so much at first,
for with a wild shriek, my gentle companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
suddenly caught my arm and pointed downward.</p>

<p>The floor, like that of the central altar on
the hill we had just left, was covered with
human bones, a gruesome sight for anyone, and
certainly for a woman, and made more gruesome
because of the dull lighting of the cave.
These bones also were bleached white and had
evidently been there a long time. We could
scarcely take a step without treading upon them.
I had all I could do to keep my mistress from
running back toward the mouth and thence
to the ground and it was not until I had reassured
her again and again that she would consent
to go on further.</p>

<p>As we had been compelled to pass on by our
desire to get our bearings before, so if we were
to get the treasure we would have to suffer this
now. I think if it had not been that her previous
experience on the hillock had somehow
given her some confidence, my lady could not
have endured this sight, treasure or no treasure.
But she was a brave woman and when I urged
that we were not to be balked in our search of
thousands of leagues by dead men’s bones which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
though horrible, were after all quite harmless,
she summoned her courage and we went on.</p>

<p>As our eyes became accustomed to the light,
for indeed the candle lantern cast but a dim
radiance over the vast apartment and the entrance
was so small comparatively that little
daylight came through, we saw off to the right
against that side of the cave the same kind of an
altar built of the same stones as on the hill,
though much smaller and surmounted by a
similar image as ugly as the others, though
nearer the human size. Bones of human beings,
men, women and children I judged from the
difference in sizes, lay before it, and there were
heaps of bones on the floor around it. It came
across me that it was another altar of sacrifice,
and that the worshipers had also been eaters
of flesh—cannibals! For I reasoned that in that
island and especially in that dry cave, the bodies
of the sacrificed would have been dried up,
assuming the shape of mummies, if left to themselves.
And I wondered if every cave possessed
a similar altar, and if the whole island had
simply been a place of sacrifice and death for
some prehistoric race living in other islands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
round about, like those on the horizon we could
still see; or perhaps long ages ago engulfed in
some great cataclysm of nature and sunk beneath
the ocean these thousands of years and
then raised again.</p>

<p>Turning away from the altar to the right we
found the way clear, and with a sigh of relief I
drew Mistress Lucy reluctantly on. She clung
to me and was so frightened that I finally slipped
my arm about her waist, whereat she made no
objection. She has confessed since that she was
indeed greatly pleased and that it was a comfort
to her to feel the strength and power of my
grasp.</p>

<p>Holding the lantern before me, I cautiously
proceeded further into the cave toward the inner
wall. The cave wall apparently opened out into
rooms. I did not dare go any distance from the
main entrance for fear that I should lose my way,
so I stopped undecided what to do; which opening
to enter, that is.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us go back,” begged my mistress,
“there is no treasure here, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” I answered, “with your permission,
Mistress Wilberforce, I intend to explore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
further into the matter. Let us see.” I held
the lantern high above my head as I spoke.
There above the entrance I saw a rude Latin
cross! “Look,” I continued, “someone has been
here, ’tis the sign of the cross!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, her hopes reviving and her
spirits returning a little at the unwonted sight
of that sacred symbol of our faith in this place of
idolatry and superstition, “don’t you remember
on the map marking the position of the cave
there was a little cross?”</p>

<p>“So there was,” I exclaimed, “although the
reading did not mention it.”</p>

<p>“No, but it is there, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>I stooped down—the entrance was scarcely
three feet high but quite broad—and made to go
through.</p>

<p>“Wait!” She seized me in great alarm.
“You cannot go in there and leave me here,” she
cried.</p>

<p>“I promise you that I will not stir three feet
from the entrance, if you will suffer me that
far,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I must come, too, then,” she urged.</p>

<p>“I will see what is there first, and if it is safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
you shall come with me immediately,” I
answered, giving her no time for further
objection.</p>

<p>As I spoke, I crawled through and found
myself in another smaller chamber. There
being no visible danger, I stretched out my hand
to her and brought her through after me. From
some distant crevice the air came to us, we could
feel it blow upon us, and it was sweet. Also I
could hear water bubbling over rocks in the
distance. It was a little damp in the cave, perhaps
because of that. There was little light,
however, save that cast by the lantern. I could
not see the further wall.</p>

<p>We did not need to go further into the cave,
for there before us, clearly enough revealed by
the dim radiance of the lamp, lay a number of
large wooden boxes or chests, moldy and ancient.
The boxes had once been iron strapped, but we
found the iron had rusted and the wood had
rotted. I stepped over to one of them, lifted
the lid which crumbled at my touch, and there
was the treasure—ingots of gold and silver!
Thousands of pounds lay to our hands! The
old buccaneer had told the truth. The story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the parchment was not a romance, the plunder
of the ancient galleon was there.</p>

<p>I have read, as you all have, the great romance
of Daniel DeFoe, and the uselessness of this mass
of gold and silver of which the Spaniards had
robbed the natives, making them toil to death
in the mines, for which Sir Philip Wilberforce’s
men had fought and died, for which the men
on <i>The Rose of Devon</i> had committed murder,
and which, had we been able to dispose of it,
would have bought anything the world had to
offer, came home to me, as in similar circumstances
Robinson Crusoe had the same thought.
For my part I would gladly have exchanged it
all for a stout boat and a clear passage through
the reef with a chance for freedom.</p>

<p>“Well, your great-great-great-grandfather,
for how many generations back I know not, was
right,” I said at last. “The treasure is here and
we have found it. It is yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, to whom the same thought
had come, “but now that we have found it of
what value or use is it?”</p>

<p>“None,” I admitted, “that I can see that is,
but there is a certain satisfaction in having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
found it, and in knowing that you can own it
even if you cannot take it away. I am glad
that events have proved that we came on no
fool’s errand.”</p>

<p>“And what may be its value, think you?”</p>

<p>“It would make good ballast for a ship,” I
answered lightly.</p>

<p>“But if we could take it hence to England?”</p>

<p>“Millions, I can only guess.”</p>

<p>“I will give you one-half of it for your share,”
she said, laughing softly.</p>

<p>“I want none of it,” I returned seriously
enough.</p>

<p>What possessed her to do it, I know not, and
she has since confessed she knows not either.
We stood there, looking down upon the useless
heap of treasure, when she turned to me on a
sudden.</p>

<p>“Now that you have seen it, are you still of
the same mind,” she asked mischievously, “that
you would give up your portion of the treasure—for
me?”</p>

<p>“Great God!” I exclaimed, moved beyond
measure by her imprudent remark, and thrown
off my balance by her—dare I say coquetry? “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
would give up the world itself for you. Don’t
you know it?”</p>

<p>And I made a step toward her, but she put up
her hand.</p>

<p>“Hush! stay! Master Hampdon,” she cried
affrighted at the consequences of her pleasantry,
“remember—”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget,” I said grimly. “This
treasure removes you further away from me than
ever.”</p>

<p>“What mean you?”</p>

<p>“When you get back to England and take
your place once more among your friends in
that society to which your birth entitles you and
which this wealth will enable you to sustain—”</p>

<p>“And who is to take me back to England?”</p>

<p>“I.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I know not, but I shall do it.”</p>

<p>“And with the treasure?”</p>

<p>“With the treasure, too, at least a sufficiency
of it for all your needs.”</p>

<p>“And when you have done this amazing thing
for me, you expect to disappear from my life,
Master Hampdon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Aye, if need be.”</p>

<p>She laughed, and I did not understand the
meaning of that laugh, either.</p>

<p>“Is it not idle for us to speculate upon treasures
which we cannot carry hence, and which
in our present situation are not so useful to us
as the little pieces of flint and steel with the
tinder in the pocket of your coat?” she asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>“You are right,” I answered, smiling in turn,
although what it cost me to smile in the face of
the picture of the future that came to me, you
cannot imagine. “But let us search and see if
there be anything else. Your ancestor spoke of
jewels.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “there should be a smaller
casket, let us look further.”</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen large boxes. I
opened them all. Some were quite empty, with
little piles of dust in them, and a few shreds of
color here and there which indicated silk had
been packed in them. There were also broken
barrels around which still clung a faint odor
of spices. There were piles of rotted débris
further on, and as I stirred one of them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
my sheath sword I struck something more
solid. I brushed aside what seemed to be
the decayed remains of cordage and wood
and finally came upon a smaller casket bound,
strapped, hinged, and cornered with some
kind of metal which I afterward found to be
silver—iron would have rusted long since. The
casket was about a foot long by six inches wide
and six inches deep. The metal which completely
covered it was curiously chased. The
casket was locked. I crumbled the wood in my
hands, but could not open the lock. The edge
of my axe, however, proved a potent key and at
last I forced it apart. As I did so out fell a
little heap of what I judged to be precious
stones. There were green, red, blue, and white
ones, among them many pearls sadly discolored
and valueless. The stones glistened with an
almost living energy. My mistress was more
familiar with these things than I, and I presented
a handful to her.</p>

<p>“Why, they are precious stones!” she cried, in
an awe-struck whisper. “Look,” she held up a
diamond as big as her thumb nail; it sparkled
like a sun in the candlelight. “And there is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
emerald,” she cried, picking up one of the green
stones, “this blue one is a sapphire, this a ruby.
Why,” she exclaimed, “here is a fortune alone.
These jewels must be of fabulous value. The
gold and silver we might leave behind, but these
we can carry with us.”</p>

<p>In my heart I was sorry we had found them,
yet I had the grace immediately to say,</p>

<p>“I am glad for that. We must gather them
up, but where shall we put them?”</p>

<p>“In the pockets of your coat for the present,”
she answered.</p>

<p>Now there were not so many of them, perhaps
three or four handfuls, not nearly enough
to fill the casket. I figured that it had been a
jewel box with little trays or drawers, and that
the stones had been wrapped separately but had
all fallen together when the partitions rotted
away. I easily found room for them in the
capacious side pockets of my coat and then we
turned back to the outer room. Passing by the
hideous altar we gained the open day again. It
was now late in the afternoon, we found to our
surprise. And yet how sweet it was, that outer
air, after those caves of death and treasure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>We had spent hours over the search, and we
had just time to retrace our steps and get back
to the boat on the beach and partake of our evening
meal when night fell. As we sat by the fire
that night, I made two little bags out of a piece
of canvas taken from a bread bag, and we put
the jewels into them, dividing them into equal
parts. One bag she wore constantly thereafter
on her person, and I the other.</p>

<p>My mistress was at first anxious to stow them
away in some crack or cranny of the rock, but I
said, I scarcely knew why, that it would be better
to keep them always with us, and so we did.
She insisted that the rough and ready division
we had made was permanent, that the bag I
carried belonged to me and the bag she carried
belonged to her. But I refused to have it so in
spite of her argument and there we left it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<span class="small">WHEREIN THE SERPENT ENTERS THE EDEN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the next two or three days we
leisurely explored the island. There
was much in it of interest, of course, but nothing
else which merits any particular description or
has any bearing on this story. We did not again
visit the central hill, nor did we enter any other
cave. We did not even go near the treasure
cave again, on the contrary we kept to the open.
There were charming groves within the walls,
but we could not bear to be shut up within the
great cup. It seemed not unlike a prison to us.
Outside we could at least see the vast expanse
of the restless ocean. We chose to live near the
sea on the beach which was high above all tides
and which was far removed from the charnel
spots which made a mockery of the sylvan
groves within the walls. The island was well
provided with tropical fruits, many being good
for food, as I knew. We caught fish in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
lagoon and turtle on the sand. We could make
a fire and cook our food. There was salt in
plenty. My tailoring and cobbling stood the
test. We lacked nothing to make us comfortable,
even happy, except the means of escape.
My comrade was never in better health in her
life. Roses bloomed in her cheeks again and I—I
was more than contented in her society.</p>

<p>We spent our days in trying to devise some
means of getting across the reef and back home
again, that is when I was not idly lying at the
feet or following the footsteps of the woman I
loved. I didn’t want to get away so far as I
was concerned. I didn’t care whether we ever
got away. I had wit enough not to let her see,
not to let her suspect that for a moment, however—at
least I made the endeavor—and I tried
to convince her by my actions at least that my
kissing her on the ship had been but a momentary
madness, but I learned later that I failed lamentably.
She says now that a baby could see
that I was dying for her, and I suppose it is true,
but at least I didn’t say anything. After that
outbreak in the cave I kept silence.</p>

<p>As I look back upon those days I scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
think she treated me kindly, and yet I know not.
I was at once happy and miserable—very happy
in her presence, very miserable in the thought
that I was and could be nothing to her. She
played upon me as if I had been a pipe, she led
me on and she repelled me, she drew me and she
drove me. I had wit, however, to see that she
was enjoying it, even if I did not; and I was in
some measure content that she should be glad.
It was a fool’s paradise in which we lived. We
had no care, nothing could touch us, nothing
could hurt us—at least so we fancied. We had
water in plenty and enough to eat of pleasant
variety, fruit, fish fresh caught from the lagoon,
the meat and eggs of the turtle, relieved by the
edibles we had brought from the ship, of which
we still had some small store left. The air was
soft and balmy, the birds sang, the flowers
bloomed. We were young, I loved blindly, passionately;
she, as I know now though I never
suspected it then, with her beautiful eyes open—that
is if eyes that love are ever open. Eden,
Eden! Ah it was there!</p>

<p>We made frequent trips up the stairs and into
the cup of the island, we traversed as much of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the wall as possible, although that was but little
because the sharp, jagged edges when we left
the path would have cut our feet to pieces. We
fished, we launched the boat on the lagoon and
rowed clear around the island. I left her sometimes
that she might refresh herself in dips
within the cool water, while I did the same
further away and out of sight. Like Adam and
Eve we lived in that Garden and dallied with the
forbidden fruit even if we did not eat it. Aye,
and the serpent came, as of old, into that soft
Pacific Paradise.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon we stood at the head of
the stairs looking seaward. We had come from
a long ramble throughout the cup of the island
and as we stood on the top our gaze as usual
instinctively turned toward the sea, perhaps seeking
for the sail of some rescuing ship. The
water was black with great formidable looking
war canoes!</p>

<p>We could not believe our eyes at first. We
stared at the water in amazement, motionless,
awe-struck, appalled. This time it was I who
came to my senses first.</p>

<p>“Great God!” I cried, “look yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“I see, I see,” she cried, in turn. “Who can
they be?”</p>

<p>“Dwellers from the other islands to the westward,”
I answered.</p>

<p>They could not see us yet fortunately but, after
all, that mattered little save as a temporary
respite. Strangely enough, my lady did not
seem to be nearly so disturbed as I.</p>

<p>“The reef will protect us again,” she said at
last, looking at me confidently.</p>

<p>“Not for a moment,” I answered, “they will
ride that reef in those light canoes more easily
than we did.”</p>

<p>“And you think—” she instantly began.</p>

<p>“Our lives are in God’s hands. If I know
anything these will be ferocious, bloodthirsty
savages. See, they are armed.”</p>

<p>I pointed to one tall brown man who stood up
in the bow of the nearest canoe, flourishing a
broad-bladed spear.</p>

<p>“We must hide,” she said.</p>

<p>“But where? They will search the whole
island as soon as they discover our boat and
other belongings and realize that some strangers
are here. Where can we find concealment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“In the treasure cave, of course,” she answered
promptly.</p>

<p>And indeed that was the most likely spot.
We had brought but little with us that afternoon.
I had thrust a brace of pistols in my belt and she
herself, by my advice, always carried her two
smaller ones, and I had my sword and axe, but
everything else was with the boat on the beach
under the cliff. For a moment I thought of running
down there and getting some of our things,
but as I half turned to descend the stairs, she
detained me, divining my purpose.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she urged, clasping my arm with
both hands, “we must make shift with what we
have. You could not go and come in time.
Perhaps they may not discover us, they may not
understand the boat if they are only savages.
We can hide safely until they depart, it may be.
Come, let us go.”</p>

<p>There was sense in her remarks. It might be
that after performing some awful worship these
most unwelcome visitors would return as they
came. And by keeping closely hid we might
escape an encounter with them. As ever in the
emergency she gave the better counsel. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
I deplored more than I can say that I
could not get to the arms and other things under
the cliff on the beach near the boat. They
would certainly find everything as soon as they
crossed the reef and landed, although what it
would tell them and what they would do only
time would determine. But there was no help
for that now. We had to make the best of a bad
situation.</p>

<p>We turned and ran back down the path across
the wall. I had forethought to gather a number
of cocoanuts and some other fruit as we
passed. I filled my own pockets and then she
made a bag out of her tunic and carried the rest.
Presently I reflected that we had no need for
such haste. There would be plenty of time for
us to reach the cave and conceal ourselves long
before they landed, so we progressed more
slowly. It was almost dusk when we reached
our shelter. I had uprooted a small tree just
before we started to climb the pile of stones
which I used as a lever to push down the heap
in every direction as we climbed so that it would
be impossible for anyone else to enter the cave
without piling up the stones again. We passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
by the stone altar and its skeletons, crept into the
inner room, flung ourselves panting upon the
sand and there we waited.</p>

<p>In that secret and secluded shelter I thought
that we were safe for the time being. Especially
was I sure that they would make no effort
to find us at night, as the place had anciently
been some sort of a shrine and was probably held
sacred still. And in the morning I did not
think that they would chance upon that particular
cave out of the many in the coral walls
without a long search, unless they had proposed
coming just there for other reasons than we
attributed to them. Even if they did stumble
upon our hiding place early in the hunt, which
I felt sure would be made for us as soon as they
discovered evidences of our presence on the
island in the shape of the dinghy, or at least at
daybreak, it would take them some time to rebuild
the pyramid of rock against the wall
again; and when they did enter the outer
room they would find it a matter of extreme difficulty
to get into the inner chamber so long as I
was there. Unfortunately, we had brought no
powder and ball with us. We had no means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
reloading our firearms, once they had been discharged.
I resolved to reserve the four pistols
we had for the last emergency. For other weapons
I had my axe and sword, to say nothing of
the loose stones and even of the human skulls
about the altar.</p>

<p>I have said, I think, that the inner cave was
slightly damp. The dampness rose from a
spring of water which bubbled away in some
dark corner which we had not cared to explore.
We had what provisions we had brought with
us left over from our luncheon, which I had
luckily preserved instead of throwing them
away, and an armful of cocoanuts and other
fruit. These, however, would last us but a short
while. If they could not come at us by force,
they could easily starve us out. Also they could,
without too much trouble or danger, make themselves
masters of the outer cave. Indeed, I
scarcely thought it would be wise for me to attempt
to prevent that, and in that case they could
wall up the entrance and leave us there.</p>

<p>It did not occur to us for a single moment that
they had any knowledge of the treasure, and that
they could be after that. Not for even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
thousandth part of a second did I dream the
savages were led by Pimball, Glibby, and most
of the other seamen of <i>The Rose of Devon</i>. I
did not know then, although I have since heard
the whole story from the survivors, that <i>The
Rose of Devon</i> had gone ashore in the terrific
storm I have described, there had been a battle
with the savages who sought to plunder the ship,
but which was prevented at frightful loss to the
islanders who were unable to contend successfully
against the firearms with which the ship
was so abundantly provided. A means of communication
between the ship and the shore had
been found subsequently, through one of the seamen
who had sailed the South Seas. The savages
had been told of the treasure, of which
indeed they had some dim traditions from days
gone by; they also held the cave as one of their
most sacred spots, scarcely less sacred than the
great altar on the hillock in the center of the
island, for what reason I cannot tell.</p>

<p>By some persuasion, I know not what, Pimball
and Glibby had won them over. Together
they had organized an expedition to come and
seize us and take the treasure. <i>The Rose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
Devon</i> was not badly damaged, she had been
floated and found to be still seaworthy. The
savages naturally cared little or nothing for the
gold or silver, and I divined later that Pimball
had promised to turn us over to them for such
purposes as the reader can well imagine. After
tortures, we would inevitably be killed and eaten.</p>

<p>I did not figure this out then, of course. If
I had guessed it, I believe I should have been
so blindly furious that I should have sallied out
and attacked them at the giant stairs. Indeed,
that would have been no bad place for defense
if the stairway had been but a little narrower.
Had I been alone perhaps I should have defied
them there, but I had my lady to look to and I
dared take no chances. I could not force the
fighting.</p>

<p>We sat silent in the cave for a long time. I
had not lighted the ship’s lantern we had left
there at our last visit, having no use for it elsewhere
on the island, since we went to bed at dark
and rose at dawn, for some of the light of the dying
day filtered through from the outside cave.
There was nothing that we needed light for
anyway. We sat close together on the remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of one of the chests to protect us from the damp
sand. I always carried with me a flask of
spirits. Not that I am a drinking man, I left
and still leave that practice to the gallants of the
day, but I have found it useful in some dire
emergency, and now as Mistress Lucy shivered
in the chill, damp air, I heartened her and
strengthened her with a dram.</p>

<p>As it was summer and not far from the line,
I had not brought the boat cloak with us. I
had not even worn my sailor’s jacket, but my
mutilated leather waistcoat was heavy and warm
and I was thankful that I had it. The pieces
which I had cut from it for the soles of her
little shoes had not spoiled it for wear either,
since I had been careful in their selection. I
took it off and despite her protestations slipped
it on her. In girth it was big enough to encircle
her twice, which was all the better for
her comfort. I drew it around to cover her
breast with a double fold and with a length of
line I had in my pocket I made it fast. We sat
close together and talked in low whispers and
I thrilled at the contact of her sweet presence in
spite of our peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>How long we talked or how long we waited
I have no means of telling. It grew dark in
the cave very early and when I ventured into the
outside room after what seemed an interminable
wait, I found night had fallen. I felt pretty
sure that we need apprehend no attack that night
and yet it was necessary to keep watch, so I proposed
that one of us should sleep while the other
listened. Naturally she was the first to take
rest. It was too damp and cold to lie down on
the sand, so I wedged myself against one of the
least rotted of the chests whose shape had been
kept intact by the pile of gold and silver bars it
had contained, and somewhat hesitatingly offered
her the shelter of my arm.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said, with all the formality I
could muster, “you must have sleep. You cannot
lie upon this damp sand, it is bad enough to sit
upon it; but upon my shoulder and within the
support of my arm you shall have rest.”</p>

<p>“I trust you,” she replied, coming closer to
me, “and if I am to sleep I know that I shall be
safe within your arms.”</p>

<p>“As my sister, had I one, or as my mother,
were she alive and here, will I support you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
said I, which was, I must admit, untrue, for I
had a great to-do to keep my arm from trembling,
and I felt sure she would hear my heart
throbbing madly when she nestled close to me,
her head upon my shoulder. And she has since
admitted that she did feel the tremor and hear
the throb, whereat she was most glad. But
I knew nothing of that then, nor for a long time
after.</p>

<p>Before she closed her eyes, however, she made
her evening prayer for herself and for me, and
then she made me promise that I would awaken
her when I judged it to be midnight, and upon
my promise she nestled down and went to sleep,
her head upon my shoulder. Surely never had
man a more precious charge than I that night!</p>

<p>I sat there motionless, my bared sword at my
side, listening. I could hear nothing, no sound
except her soft breathing and once in a while
the sough of the night wind through the trees
outside, which penetrated faintly into the cave,
and at more infrequent intervals the cry of some
night bird came to me, but there was no sound
of humanity. How long I sat there, I know
not. It was my purpose to keep awake the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
through, and I think I must have kept awake the
greater part thereof, but toward morning my
head dropped back on the pile of ingots and I
fell asleep. Yet I did not relax my clasp upon
the sleeping figure lying upon my breast. It
was she who awakened when the dim light began
to sift through the narrow opening into the little
cave where we sat.</p>

<span class="small">IN WHICH WE ARE BELEAGUERED IN THE CAVE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MASTER HAMPTON,” she said, bending
over me, having arisen without
disturbing me, “it is morning.”</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet instantly, as she shook me
gently, and grasped my sword as I did so,
whereat she laughed.</p>

<p>“Why did you not awaken me?” she asked
reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I must have—” I began in
great confusion.</p>

<p>“You must have gone to sleep yourself,” she
laughed again, and I marveled, but thankfully,
to see her so cheerful.</p>

<p>“I am ashamed,” I replied, “that I should
have failed in my duty to keep good watch. I
didn’t awaken you when I might because you
needed sleep yourself, and then like a great
animal I went to sleep myself.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” she said, smiling at me, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
could just see her lovely face faintly in the dark
twilight of the cave, “that you did since nothing
happened.”</p>

<p>“It is just as well then,” I said, smiling in turn,
“we have both slept soundly and well. I feel
greatly refreshed.”</p>

<p>“And I.”</p>

<p>“Thank God,” I said fervently.</p>

<p>“What is to be done now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“First breakfast.”</p>

<p>I broke open a cocoanut with my axe, I had
become expert at it, and we had food and drink
in plenty, and for variety some of the hard bread
which still remained and other fruit. I lighted
the lantern for a moment and went toward the
sound of the falling water. The cocoanut shell
made an excellent cup and I brought her enough
clear, cool, sweet water to lave her face and
hands. Save for the stiffness of the constrained
position and some slight pain caused by the damp
we were both fit for any adventure. Well, we
should have need of all our strength doubtless.
When we finished our meal and our refreshing
ablutions, she looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Well, what next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“The next thing,” said I, “is to see what is
toward.”</p>

<p>“You won’t leave the cave,” she said, catching
me by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I should find it difficult were I so minded,”
I answered, smiling and thrilling to her touch
again as always. Indeed, I have never got used
to it even after all these years. As I look back
on the scenes of the past now I do not think I
have ever had happier moments in my life than
those in which she clung to me and was dependent
upon me.</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You forget that we broke down the way last
night.”</p>

<p>“But you are a sailor, you might make shift.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not you,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Without me?”</p>

<p>“Without you I go nowhere.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Come,” said I, “let us go into the outer room.
We may find out something.”</p>

<p>I had wound my watch in the dark and looked
at it now as we came into the light. It was three
bells in the morning watch, or about half after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
nine. We went past the altar with its grim bony
circle of attendants, and stared through the entrance.
There was an open space at the foot of
the cliff forty or fifty yards wide perhaps before
the jungle began. After looking some time and
seeing nothing I foolishly—and yet it would
have made no difference in the end—stepped out
upon the shelf which made a sort of platform in
front of the cave and Mistress Lucy fearlessly
came with me.</p>

<p>We had scarcely appeared in view when to
our astounded surprise we heard the report of a
firearm and a heavy bullet struck the coral wall
just over our heads. I had just time to mark the
spot whence it came, by the betraying smoke, as
I leaped back into the shelter carrying my precious
charge before me. I was puzzled beyond
measure. I was certain that the savages in these
parts of the South Seas knew nothing about firearms
and I could not account for it. The
shower of arrows and spears that now came
through the opening and fell harmlessly on the
sand I could easily account for, but not that shot.
What could it mean? I felt that I could hold
my own against savages without difficulty, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
if there were European enemies there the case
was different.</p>

<p>“That,” said I solemnly, “was a narrow
escape.”</p>

<p>“Do these islanders have firearms?” she asked,
the same thought in her mind.</p>

<p>“I never heard of it,” I replied. “I cannot
account for it.”</p>

<p>“I can, though,” she said; “just before the discharge
of that gun I caught sight of a man in
clothes such as you wear. Is it possible that it
could be one from <i>The Rose of Devon</i>?”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, a light at once breaking
upon me.</p>

<p>“It is quite likely,” I answered, “now it is certain.”</p>

<p>At this moment our further conversation was
interrupted by a hail. To our great amazement
we heard in that lonely island my own name
called! That hail could only come from a survivor
of the ship. It confirmed our surmises
about the shot.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” the cry came to us, “will
you respect a flag of truce? If so, show yourself
at the opening and I shall do the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Don’t go,” cried my little mistress, hearing
all, “they are utterly without honor, and—”</p>

<p>“I think it will be best for me to appear,” I
said. “Stand clear so that if any treacherous
movement be made I shall have space to leap
backward, and meanwhile look to your
weapons.”</p>

<p>I examined my own pistols and then calling
out loudly that I would faithfully observe the
flag of truce, I stepped out into the open. There
below me on the edge of the glade, convenient
to a tree behind which he could leap, for the
rascal trusted me apparently as little as I trusted
him, stood the wretch, Pimball. Back of him
beneath the trees I distinguished Glibby and a
number of the crew, nearly all of them, I should
judge, and back of these were massed the savages.
Pimball had a white neckcloth tied to
the muzzle of his gun.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Master Hampdon,” he began
suavely.</p>

<p>To that salutation I made no reply. I did not
deign even to pass the time of day with such a
man as he.</p>

<p>“Say what you have to say and be quick about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
it,” I said haughtily, but he looked past me and
took off his hat with a profound sweep.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mistress Wilberforce,” he
cried.</p>

<p>I turned in a hurry and found that she had
stepped out by my side, completely disobeying
my positive direction. The two of us presented
a fair mark for any weapon; one might escape,
but hardly two if Pimball’s men opened fire.</p>

<p>“Get back!” I cried harshly in mingled amazement
and dismay.</p>

<p>“I stay where you are,” she answered firmly.
“See, I, too, am armed,” her little hand lifted
her own pistol.</p>

<p>“I can talk with the two of you jest as well as
with one, or even better,” interposed Pimball
smoothly, “an’ the lady won’t need her pistol.”</p>

<p>“Talk on and be brief,” I returned, seeing
there was no use in arguing with my little mistress
who always did have her own way in the
end.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i290.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“She had stepped out by my side.”</p>

<p>Yet I did take the precaution to interpose my
bulk between the man on the ground and my
lady who strove to move around me, but I stubbornly
held my position and compelled her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
keep in the background where she was in less
danger.</p>

<p>“You’ve found the treasure,” he began,
“there ain’t no use denyin’ it; we’ve l’arnt from
our savage friends that the stuff is there. In
years gone by they sacrificed here an’ on the cone
yonder, but for generations the island has been
taboo. The comin’ of the white man has broke
the ban an’ we’re here to take the treasure away
with us.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said I sarcastically, whereat he
turned pale with anger but still mastered himself.</p>

<p>“We offer you,” he continued, “safety. We
can’t take you with us, but we’ll leave you here
on the island arter we have fetched away the
treasure.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I returned, “you are vastly
kind.”</p>

<p>He bit his lip at that and then his eyes turned
from me to my companion.</p>

<p>“If you are willin’ to give up the woman,” he
said suddenly, revealing his real villainy, “I’ll
enroll you with our followin’ an’ we’ll all git
away together on <i>The Rose of Devon</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“What of the ship?” I asked.</p>

<p>It was a hard thing to control my temper, but
I wanted the information and until I got it I
must command myself.</p>

<p>“She was badly damaged when she took
ground on the sand durin’ the storm but not entirely
wrecked, an’ is still seaworthy. We’ve
patched her up, too. We can git away in her an’
you can navigate her, or we can do without you,
for that matter, an’ make shift to git her back
to the South American coast at least.”</p>

<p>“So you offer me free passage and my share
of the treasure if I will give up Mistress Wilberforce,
do you?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” answered Pimball. “Eh,
mates?” whereat a deep chorus of approval
came from Glibby and the men.</p>

<p>“And this is my answer,” I said furiously,
leveling my pistol at him. “Get back, you villain,
or you will have looked your last on life.”</p>

<p>“But the flag of truce,” he cried, dropping his
weapon in surprise.</p>

<p>“It is not meant to cover such propositions as
yours. As for the treasure, you shall have it
when you can get it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>As I spoke he sprang behind the tree and motioned
to his men to fire, but I was too quick for
him, and we were safely behind the walls of the
cave when the sound of the reports came to us.
I had carried my mistress there before me in my
unceremonious backward rush.</p>

<p>“It was bravely said,” began my lady, “but if
I were not here, you—”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“You are here and if you were not they would
murder me like a sheep when they had got out
of me all they wanted.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “I suppose so. Now what is
to be done?”</p>

<p>“The next move,” said I, “is with them.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go further back into the cave?”</p>

<p>“No, we will stay here for the moment,” I replied.</p>

<p>We were not long left in suspense for I could
hear them breaking through the woods and rushing
toward the entrance. Missiles in the way of
weapons there were none in the cave, but I
picked up a skull that lay on the floor and hurled
it out of the opening into the unseen crowd below
on a venture. A shriek told me that I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
hit someone, but I saw at once that the game was
one I could not play longer, for a rain of missiles,
stones, arrows, what not, fell in the entrance.</p>

<p>These villainous white men had some skill at
warfare, it seemed. They had posted covering
parties to protect the workmen who had been
detailed to repair and make possible the approach.
I stepped cautiously toward the entrance
and peered down. I could see them
working hard, piling up the stones to enable
them to get at us, while back of them others
stood with drawn bows and presented weapons.</p>

<p>I did not come off unscathed, for as I sprang
back after having thrown another skull and
taken my look, an arrow hit me in the fleshy
part of my arm. My mistress noticed it instantly.
The stone head had broken off and it
was the work of an instant to draw out the
slender wood shaft. It was not at all a bad
wound but it was quite painful. The next
thing she did amazed me beyond measure, for
before I could prevent it my mistress had put
her lips to the wound.</p>

<p>“What mean you?” I cried when I could recover
myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“It might have been poisoned,” she said
quietly, looking at me with luminous eyes, “and
I cannot have you die!”</p>

<span class="small">HOW WE FIGHT FOR LIFE IN THE CAVERN OF

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;WAS amazed, astounded even, at her hardihood
in sucking any possible poison out of
that wound in my arm at so great a risk to her
own life, if the weapon had been envenomed.
And I was most profoundly touched, too. But
as I had had my lesson on the ship I presumed no
further; I viewed it as done out of common
humanity and to preserve a life useful to her—nothing
more. I dared not put any other construction
upon her noble action, even in thought.
Meanwhile in my turn, I took such hasty precautions
for her safety as I could while I thanked
her. I bade her rinse out her mouth thoroughly
with a mixture of the cold water and the strong
spirit of which I still had my flask nearly full.</p>

<p>By this time we had withdrawn to the back of
the outer cave. Indeed, that was the only safe
place for us, for a constant succession of weapons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
was being thrown through the opening. We
needed no further warning to keep us out of
reach. Master Pimball was showing himself
something of a general, too. He was keeping
us away from the entrance and with the great
host of men at his command he was building
up the broken-down heap of stones which would
presently enable them to come at us in force.
At least that was what I guessed from what I
had seen and what I now heard.</p>

<p>While my little mistress busied herself with
tying up my wounded arm with strips torn from
the sleeve of my shirt which I had offered for
the purpose—she had wanted to make bandages
out of her underwear but I stayed her—I considered
what was to be done. I had four loaded
pistols and therefore four lives in my hand. No
man could show his head in that entrance without
receiving a shot. After that I could account
for a few more, perhaps, with sword, axe,
or naked fist, but in the end they would inevitably
master me. Unfortunately, the entrance
was broad enough for four or more to enter
abreast easily.</p>

<p>Should I open the battle there or retreat into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
the inner cave and wait, was the question that
had to be decided. Perhaps the latter would
be the safer plan but I had a strange unwillingness
to adopt it, for once within I feared we
should never get out alive except as prisoners,
so long as they held the outer cave and I could
never dislodge them from it. There was not
much more chance of getting out alive from the
outer cave, for that matter, but still it seemed so.
We could at least see the sky and the sunlight.
Should we stay there or go further into the wall?</p>

<p>I decided upon the former course. I explained
to my mistress that I would keep the
outer cave as long as I could, begging her to retreat
to the inner chamber. She demurred at
first, but when I spoke to her peremptorily at
last—God forgive me—she acceded to my request
humbly enough. Indeed, she saw that in
this matter I could not be denied and also perhaps
that I had right and prudence on my side.
Her presence would only have embarrassed me
in my fighting although I could quite understand
that she wanted to fight, too. It was in
her blood and she has since confessed that she
never expected that we would come through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
conflict alive and she would fain have died by
my side. But that was not to be, and so, for the
once she obeyed me.</p>

<p>I thrust the best pistol into her hand and
told her to reserve it for herself in case her capture
was inevitable, but not to pull the trigger
until the last moment. And I promised her
faithfully that I would not foolishly or uselessly
jeopard myself but that after I had made what
fight I could, I would join her if it were in any
way possible.</p>

<p>Even then she hung in the wind awhile, seeming
loath to go when all had been said between
us. Finally she approached me, laid her hand
on my arm and looked up at me. Seeing that
she had previously decided to go and said so,
I wondered what was coming now.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she said softly, “here we
be a lone man and woman among these savages
and murderers with but little chance for our
lives, I take it. I am sorry that I struck you on
the ship—and—you may—kiss—me—good-by.”</p>

<p>With that she proffered me her lips. I could
face a thousand savages, a hundred Pimballs,
without a quiver of the nerves, but at these unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
words and that wonderful condescension,
my knees fairly smote together before this
small woman. I stood staring down at her.</p>

<p>“You were once over eager to take from me
by force what I now offer you willingly,” she
said, half turning away in a certain—shall I
say disappointment?</p>

<p>With that I caught her to me and once again
I drank the sweetness of her lips. We were
bound to die and I kissed her as a man does
when he loves a woman. I forgot the savages
outside, the stones, the spears, the arrows streaming
through the entrance, the yells and curses
that came to us. I held her in my arms and
without resistance. I could have held her there
forever, quite willing to die in such sweet embrace.
She pushed me away from her at last and
I could swear that my kisses had been returned,
and then with a whispered blessing she dropped
to her knees and crawled within the adjoining
cave.</p>

<p>I could have fought the world, thereafter, for
her kisses intoxicated me like wine. Yet even
then I did not delude myself. I felt that on
her part at least, it was a farewell kiss such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
two true devoted comrades might give to each
other in the face of death. I said to myself that
to her the pressure of my lips had only been as
the salute of an ancient gladiator about to die was
to the Cæsar who watched the struggle. To
me—well I blessed her even for that crowning
mercy.</p>

<p>With a pistol in each hand and the third upon
a rock close at hand I waited. I had not long
to wait. There was a sudden fiercer rain of
arrows and spears, some of which struck at my
feet or by my side. I gathered up a sheaf of
them and laid them at hand beside the pistol on
the rock.</p>

<p>The next instant two tremendous savages and
a white man appeared in the entrance. The shot
was easy, the target fine. I couldn’t miss. The
first bullet went into the brain of Master Glibby,
the next tore off the head of the leading chief.
Reserving the third pistol, I seized a spear and
drove it through the throat of the other savage.
I shouted with triumph, and Mistress Lucy has
since confessed to me that, kneeling down and
peering through the opening, contrary to my explicit
order which was for her to seek safe cover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
she saw all and that my call of victory was the
sweetest sound she had ever heard.</p>

<p>I thought we had done, but they were an indomitable
lot, those South Sea islanders, and they
were well urged. Four others took their places
at once, spears in hands, which they threw at me.
I dodged them with some difficulty and let fly the
third pistol. They came crowding this time and
the bullet from the heavy weapon accounted for
two others, but the survivors had gained a footing,
and the shelf behind them was suddenly
filled with lifting heads and climbing men.</p>

<p>I clubbed my weapons and hurled them one
after another fair and square into the mass. One
man went down with a broken skull. The rush
was checked, they gave back a little. I cast
spears and arrows at them but now the shield men
had come up and they caught the missiles on
their shields. The front rank wavered and perhaps
if they had been unsupported, they might
have been driven below, but the crowd behind
would not let them retire. Slowly they began
to move toward me.</p>

<p>I doubt not I was a terrible figure, for I had
whipped out my cutlass by this time and stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
at bay. I had forgotten for the moment all else
but the lust of the conflict and in another second
I had flung myself upon them in a fury. It was
my mistress who recalled me to myself.</p>

<p>“Save yourself,” she shrieked, “they are upon
you. Come hither.”</p>

<p>With that I dropped down and made a spring
for the opening. I had waited too long. The
leading man would have pinned me to the earth
with his spear. The entrance was wide fortunately,
and Mistress Lucy would see through
the part I did not block with my huge bulk.
Again disregarding entirely my instructions, she
fired the last pistol at that nearest man. He
went down like a ninepin, both legs broken,
which gave me time to gain the inner chamber
and stand upright. I was bleeding for I had
been cut here and there, but was otherwise all
right.</p>

<p>“That shot saved my life,” I cried panting,
“you should have kept it for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I can find means to die,” she answered, “if
by naught else, by your sword blade.”</p>

<p>“Good,” I exclaimed, proud of her prowess
and her resolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>They gave us no time for further speech for
urged by what promises of reward, what passionate
hatred, what bestial desire, I know not, they
came on. The narrow entrance was suddenly
black with the islanders who thrust their spears
at us. Fortunately my mistress had moved aside
and was out of range, but I was perilously near
being cut down. Mistress Lucy had the sword
which I had thrust into her hand, and I the great
axe which I had cast into the inner cave ahead
of me.</p>

<p>Those outside were even less able to see than
we and perhaps they thought we had withdrawn,
or been driven back, for they crept forward
with assurance.</p>

<p>While I had lived in the gardener’s lodge at
Wilberforce Castle, I had got to be quite an axe-man.
I brought down the heavy weapon on the
first head, striking with just enough force to
kill and yet leave me able to recover myself without
delay, and when three heads had been
knocked that way in rapid succession with no
more damage to me than a trifling spear cut on
the ankle, the battle stopped for a moment. I
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“Come on, you dogs!” I shouted, “I can play
at that game until you are more tired of it
than I.”</p>

<p>I spoke without thought, however, for those
outside the opening drew back the bodies by
their legs and thus cleared the entrance. I
judged that the outer cave, which was large and
spacious, was now filled with men. They were
shouting and gesticulating in great excitement.
But none made any effort to enter. Finally, I
heard a human voice speaking English. It was
Pimball.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Speak not to me, murdering villain,” I
answered.</p>

<p>“Now this is madness,” he shouted. “You are
trapped like rats; we have only to wall up the
entrance or build a fire in front of it an’ you will
both die.”</p>

<p>“It is a thousand times better to die so,” I answered
shortly, “than to live with craven men
like you.”</p>

<p>“You are a fool,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He dropped down on his knees as he spoke
and I could see his face in the opening but too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
far away for me to swing my axe. If it were
my last effort I was determined that I would get
him, and so I waited.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose the sword,” I cried to my lady
across the chamber where her white face stared
at me out of the dimness.</p>

<p>“I shall not,” she answered undauntedly.</p>

<p>Then I lifted the axe and waited for Master
Pimball and his men to come on, but he had a
better plan. Bullets and powder they had in
plenty and he knew from the fact that I had
thrown my pistols at them that I had none left.
With a deafening roar a storm of bullets from a
dozen weapons swept the cave. I leaped back.
I had to, or I should have been shot where I
stood. Of the way thus opened they took instant
advantage and under cover of a second volley
they sought to enter. Well, it was all up, all
I could do was to leap upon them as they rose
and—</p>

<p>But that moment the solid rock beneath my
feet began to sway. It was as if I had been instantly
translated to the deck of a tossing ship.
I stood rooted to the spot trying to maintain a
balance. Pimball had lifted himself upon one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
knee and was almost clear of the entrance, but
he too stopped, appalled. A sickening feeling
of apprehension that all the savages on earth
would not have inspired came over me. My
mistress screamed faintly. The natives outside
broke into terror stricken shouts and cries, an
oath burst from the lips of the leader of the
mutineers.</p>

<p>The next moment, with a crash like a thousand
thunder peals the earth was rent in twain.</p>

<p>The earthquake shook that rocky island like
a baby’s cradle. A great mass of rock over the
entrance fell. With another roar like to the
first the cliff was riven in every direction. The
noise outside ceased. The men with Pimball
were ground to death. Upon his legs lay fifty
feet of broken rock. Darkness, total and absolute,
succeeded the dim light. I remember
realizing that the attack had failed and then
something struck me. Down upon the wet, still
quivering sand I fell and knew no more.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<span class="small">IN WHICH WE PASS THROUGH DARKNESS TO
LIGHT AND LIBERTY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WATER, icy cold, trickling upon me from
some spring opened in the wall by the
earthquake, presently brought me to myself. I
lay for a moment listening. I could hear nothing
at first, but in a little while a deep groan
and then a faint whispered prayer came to me.
I strove desperately to collect my senses and
finally I realized where I was—the cave, the
battle, the earthquake, the savages, Pimball, and
the woman!</p>

<p>“Mistress Lucy!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God,” her voice came through the
darkness hysterically, “I thought you were
killed.”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, slowly rising to my knee
and stretching my members to see if I had control
of them, which fortunately I soon discovered
I had, “I was stunned by falling rock, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
otherwise I believe I am not much hurt. How
is it with you?”</p>

<p>“I am well and unharmed.”</p>

<p>“Now God be praised,” I exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p>“For Christ’s sake, water!” interposed a
trembling, hoarse, anguished voice.</p>

<p>“Who speaks?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I, Pimball, I’m pinned to the ground, my
back is broke, I’m dyin’.”</p>

<p>“There should be a lantern here,” I said.
“I placed it—let me think, where did I place it?”</p>

<p>“It was just to the left of the opening,”
answered my little mistress.</p>

<p>I was turned around and giddy, but I managed
to fix the direction of the entrance by Pimball’s
groans and by good fortune presently found the
lantern. It would burn but a few hours, but we
never needed a light as we did then, I decided.
My flint and steel I carried ever in my pocket
and to kindle a flickering flame was but the
work of a moment. If I had not possessed it, I
would have given years of my life for even that
feeble light which threw a faint illumination
about the place.</p>

<p>There, opposite me where I had stationed her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
by God’s providence protected by a niche in the
cave from the rain of rocks which had beaten
me down, stood my mistress, safe and unharmed.
I stepped toward her and with a low cry of
thankfulness she fell into my arms. I soothed
her for a moment and then turned to the other
occupant of the chamber. The entrance was
completely blocked up, the wall had settled
down. Pimball’s legs were broken and his back
as well. It was impossible to release him, what
lay upon him weighed tons and tons.</p>

<p>“You murdering hound,” I cried, “you have
brought this upon us,” but he would only plead
piteously for water, disregarding my bitter reproaches.</p>

<p>I was for killing him outright with my cutlass,
which I picked up, but she would not have
it so. She got a half cocoanut shell, filled it
with water, and brought it to him. She bathed
his brow and gave him some to drink. It gave
him temporary relief but his minutes were numbered.
His life was going out by seconds.</p>

<p>“God!” he cried, as his eyes caught the gleam
of the gold and silver bars, “the treasure!” He
stretched out his hand toward it, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
stopped. “I’m undone,” he choked out with
a fearful scream. “Mistress!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Forgive—”</p>

<p>Indeed she forgave him, I make no doubt, but
her forgiveness came too late, for his head
dropped—he had been looking sideways—and
his face buried itself in the wet sand.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” she asked, awe-struck.</p>

<p>I nodded. No closer inspection was needed
to establish the truth of that fact.</p>

<p>“He died with a prayer for forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“And few men have ever had greater need for
that forgiveness,” said I, drawing her away.</p>

<p>“And we too shall die,” she said shuddering.
“We are buried here in the bowels of the earth,
in this treasure lined prison.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t die without a struggle,” I returned
with more confidence than I felt.</p>

<p>“What mean you?”</p>

<p>“The earthquake which closed the mouth of
the cave may have opened the other end.”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” she answered, “but not very
likely.”</p>

<p>“And besides, you remember the running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
stream on the other side of the cave, which we
did not follow?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It must run somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Where water runs men and women may find
a way.”</p>

<p>“At least it will do us no harm to try.”</p>

<p>“Come then,” said I, extending my hand to
her and holding the lantern before me for pitfalls.</p>

<p>We went down the cave. To find the water
was easy. Sure enough, it led away through a
narrow rift, in what direction we could not tell,
although its tendency was downward and I knew
that it must come out upon the beach somewhere.
It had not seemed to me, as I had examined it
before the earthquake, that the rift was more
than large enough to carry the water, but it
might have been opened wider by the shock, and
so we followed it. Although sometimes the
walls closed over the watercourse, making low
and narrow tunnels, we managed to force our
way through them. I went in the advance, for
I knew that what my body could pass would present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
no difficulty for her. We wandered in and
out among the coral until it seemed to me that
we had gone miles, although in reality it might
have been but a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>At last we came to a place too low and too
narrow for me, although I might have perhaps
thrust her through.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “this is the end.”</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” I answered, resolved never to
give over the attempt while I could move hand
or foot or draw a breath.</p>

<p>I still had the axe with me and the sword
which I had thrust into my belt. The rock
seemed soft and pliable. Lying down upon my
back and covering my eyes with one hand, I
struck at it overhead with the axe, which I
grasped near the head, thus gradually enlarging
the passage. The water flowing beneath
me was deathly cold, the candle in the
lantern was burning lower and lower, but
I hung on. Never did I work so hard,
so rapidly, so recklessly in my life as then. At
last I loosened a huge piece of the rock which
fell suddenly upon me. Had I not seen it coming
and dropped the axe and stayed its progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
with both upraised hands, it might have crushed
me. As it was, it fell fairly upon my breast.
I could not throw it aside, the way was too narrow.
I held it off with my hands and forced my
way through the opening, now barely enough to
admit my passing, although what I should meet
with or where I should bring up on the other
side, I knew not. I had no idea how large the
fallen rock was, for all its weight, but my
mistress has told me that it was a monster stone,
and that none but a giant could have carried it.
I thrust hard and harder with my feet and presently
my way was clear and I shoved myself
through the opening. With one great final effort
I rolled the rock aside and then lay on my
back on the sand, breathless, exhausted.</p>

<p>She dragged herself through the passage I
had thus made and over my body, and then knelt
by my side, kissed me, murmuring words I did
not dare to listen to lest I should go mad with
joy. And indeed, I was so exhausted that I
could scarcely credit that I had heard anything
real. Presently, however, I staggered to my feet
again. She had forgot the precious lantern, but
I went back after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>We were now in a more spacious cave; the
stream fed by other brooks had become larger;
the descent was much more rapid. The cliff
wall was, I believe, narrower at the cave than
anywhere else in the island. It was perhaps
not more than half a mile wide. We stumbled
rapidly down the long vaulted passage to the
outer wall. As we approached it, I half feared
that the rock might be solid and that the brook
might plunge beneath it, but fortune did not do
its worst for us yet. There was a rift in the wall
around which the brook ran into a sort of tunnel
or passageway, tall enough for me to stand upright
and broad enough to enable us to walk
side by side. A long distance away appeared
to me a spot of dimness. Recklessly we clasped
hands and ran.</p>

<p>Alas, when we reached the light, we found that
the entrance was closed by a huge stone. It
did not exactly fit the opening and light filtered
around it. I stood panting, staring at it.</p>

<p>“Are we to be ended now,” I cried, “after
having come thus far? Stand clear, madam,”
I shouted, not giving her time to answer.</p>

<p>Then with all my strength I swung the axe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
and struck the rock fair and square and by good
fortune upon some fissure, for it shivered and a
crack started. Once again, this time with even
more tremendous force, I swung and struck.
The axe sank into the stone, the helve shivered
in my hand. It was a right good blow, if I
do say it myself, for the rock was now fairly
split in two, the pieces falling to the right and
left. Still, the two halves yet lay within the
entrance, blocking it. We had not achieved a
clear passage.</p>

<p>I was mad now, as mad as I had been in the
outer cave fighting for her, or when I had cut
the Duke of Arcester. The blood rushed to
my face, a mist to my eyes. I stooped down
and with my naked hands I seized one piece of
that rock and with such strength as Hercules
or Samson might have used, I drew it back, lifted
it up and hurled it aside. The second piece followed
in the same way. My mistress stood staring
at me in awe mingled with terror. The
way was opened and we stepped out upon the
sand.</p>

<p>Never before or since did sunshine seem so
sweet. My muddy clothes were torn to rags,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
blood was clotted in my hair and on my forehead,
my face was black with sweat and dust,
there were wounds upon my legs and arms. I
was a gory and horrible spectacle. Mistress
Lucy had suffered no wounds, but her clothes
were rent and torn. Her face, too, was grimy,
but beneath the dust and earth stain it showed as
white as the cap of a wave.</p>

<p>“Thanks be to God,” she said at last, “and you,
we have won through.”</p>

<p>I thought she would have fainted. I caught
her by the arm, set her down upon the sand and
sprinkled the water from the brook in her face
until presently she revived.</p>

<p>“We are not safe yet,” I urged. “There were
hundreds of savages upon the island; they may
not all have been at the cave. We must go
warily, we cannot rest now.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” she answered with great spirit,
getting to her feet and stretching out her hand.
“If you will help me I can go anywhere.”</p>

<p>I still had my sword. I drew it out and led
on, keeping well under the shelter of the cliffs.
We walked up the sand toward the giant stairs.
There we saw men, islanders, on the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
wall, but my first glance told me that we had
nothing to fear from them, for the stairs were
gone. They were but a scattered heap of stones.
The false gods were down, too. I wondered
what had come to those at the main altar in the
center of the island. The earthquake had
crumbled the work of the builders of bygone
years, and as the stairs had fallen away they had
left the cliff sheer and bare for a hundred feet
or more. Those above could not come at us,
nor could we approach them, for which indeed
we had no mind.</p>

<p>“It is an act of God,” said I, “that has broken
down the stairs.”</p>

<p>“But there may be another way of descent,”
she said after a moment. “Oh, let us leave this
dreadful island!”</p>

<p>I had no hope that the dinghy had been spared,
but its place was not far away and we walked to
it in silence. It was gone. A tidal wave had
followed the earthquake. The canoes in which
the islanders had come had been dashed to pieces
and their few keepers killed. The survivors
were prisoners on the island unless their friends
came to their help, and even then, until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
could devise some way of getting down the cliff.
And we, too, were prisoners. Some of our gear,
the compass, some provisions which I had stored
in the crannies of the rock were still there, but
they were useless to us. Something else had
happened. The earthquake had broken the barrier
reef. Before us was a practicable passage to
the sea.</p>

<p>If we only had a boat! I turned to the
canoes hopeful of finding one seaworthy, and as
I did so my Mistress Lucy caught me by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Look,” she cried, pointing down the lagoon.</p>

<p>I turned and there, bottom upward, floated the
dinghy. The sight of her was like a draught of
wine. I turned and ran down the sand, followed
by my lady. When opposite the boat I kicked
off my shoes, I had on little else but shirt and
trousers, jumped into the lagoon, swam to the
dinghy and towed her ashore.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE were so excited and exhausted by the
terrific experiences which we had just
gone through that a sort of frenzy possessed us.
I know that word described my feelings and I
think it also described my lady’s feelings. We
threw the things that we had saved, or that had
escaped the earthquake and the tidal wave that
followed it, into the boat pell-mell, climbed in
ourselves, and shoved off. We could not get
away from that island quick enough and we
could not get far enough away once we started.</p>

<p>Luckily the oars had been secured to the
thwarts, and I shipped them on the rowlocks
forthwith, and then I rowed across the lagoon
and through the opening in the reef. Indeed,
the tidal wave had shattered the reef in various
places and for the first time in centuries the
sea made clean sweeps of the beach through the
many openings. It was not altogether easy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
row through the surf but it was child’s play to
our first passage over the reef. In spite of all
that I had gone through, I felt as one possessed,
and the stout ash oars fairly bent to my vigorous
strokes. When we cleared the entrance, and
got into smoother water, I shipped the oars,
stepped the mast I had made during our sojourn
on the island to take the place of the
broken one, set a small sail I had improvised
in idle moments out of some spare canvas which
I had luckily found in the after locker together
with the remaining pieces left over from my
tailoring, and then I came aft and seized the
tiller.</p>

<p>My lady had sat silent most of the time, closely
watching me, but now she asked a pertinent
question.</p>

<p>“Whither are we bound?”</p>

<p>Her interrogation recalled me to myself. I
had really given the matter no thought at all.
All that I had permitted myself to decide upon
was to get away from the island, and I had
hoisted the sail and put the boat before the wind
without a thought as to its direction.</p>

<p>It so happened—indeed, I humbly submit that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
perhaps it did not happen by chance but
was so ordered by that Providence which had
watched over us—that the wind blew directly off
the island and the boat was headed toward the
distant shores of the other islands whence the
marauders had come and where <i>The Rose of
Devon</i> had been wrecked. I recollected from
the conversation I had had with Pimball that
they had somehow floated the ship and that she
was seaworthy, and as my mistress questioned me
the daring design of seizing the ship flashed into
my mind.</p>

<p>Indeed, the enterprise was in a measure forced
upon me. We had no water in the boat, practically
no provisions. We were thousands of
miles away from the possibility of passing ships.
Unless some vessel should be blown far out of
her course by continued storms there was absolutely
no chance of our being picked up. That
small boat with its patched-up, makeshift equipment
was in no condition anyway for a long
voyage, even if we had plenty of food and water.
<i>The Rose of Devon</i> would provide everything
we needed if we once got aboard her, and while
two would be an almost impossible crew for such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
a ship, as I had said or thought, yet if any of her
spars still stood, by means of tackles I might
make shift to hoist a rag of sail. If the vessel
were still tight she could carry us indefinitely,
and perhaps by taking advantage of every wind
that was favorable we might in the end make the
South American Coast. Of course the work
would all have to be done by me, but my lady
had often steered <i>The Rose of Devon</i> during the
outward voyage, for her pleasure, and she could
relieve me long enough for me to get the absolutely
necessary sleep so long as we were aboard
her. At any rate, half-naked, hungry, thirsty,
as we were in a small boat stripped of everything,
she was our only resource. Therefore I
answered briefly.</p>

<p>“I am going to seize <i>The Rose of Devon</i> if I
can find her.”</p>

<p>“But there will be men aboard her,” said my
mistress apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” I returned, “but at most there
cannot be many of them. We saw enough on
the island to know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted the brave woman by my side,
“that is true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“No one would offer to stay on the ship when
he had a chance to hunt for treasure and for
you and me.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“They would have to be constrained to stay
there, and as I take it that the native fighting
force of the island on which the ship was cast
was in the canoes, there would not be any necessity
for guarding her heavily. Besides, two or
three with firearms could stop any attack that
might be made.”</p>

<p>“But we have no firearms,” said my lady.</p>

<p>“We have weapons,” I returned. I had picked
up the musket from a shelf of rock where I had
laid it, and she still clung to the pistol with
which she had saved my life by her adroitness.
“We have firearms,” I continued, “but they are
useless to us without powder and shot”—all that
we had, had either been washed away or wetted
so that it was of no use—“but I have my cutlass
and I consider myself a match for all the murdering
pirates that may be left on that ship.”</p>

<p>“I believe that, too,” she said, looking at me
admiringly, “when I think of your determination,
your feats of strength, your—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>“They were nothing. They did not measure
up to the inspiration I had,” said I.</p>

<p>But she shook her head at this and I continued,
not daring to notice her overmuch.</p>

<p>“I take it that those islands are four or five
leagues away,” I looked over the side, “and this
boat is making not more than three-quarters of
a league an hour. That is all we can do with
such a poor makeshift for a sail.” I looked up
into the sky, then at my watch. It was high
noon. I had not dreamed that we had been so
long in our adventures that day. “It will be
dusk before we reach the nearest island. It may
be that haply we shall find <i>The Rose of Devon</i>
there.”</p>

<p>“And if we do, what will be your plans?”</p>

<p>“I propose to douse the sail when we get near
enough to see her, which will be long before she
can see us, then wait until nightfall, take to the
oars, row alongside, fasten the boat aft, and
clamber aboard. If there are only two or three
on her there will probably be but one on watch.
I can throttle him without arousing the attention
of the others. Perhaps I can confine the others
below. Then we can cut the cable, hoist a rag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
of sail somehow, and be away before morning.”</p>

<p>“But if there are savages aboard?”</p>

<p>“I do not think there will be any, but if there
are I must even chance it.”</p>

<p>“It sounds terribly dangerous.”</p>

<p>“It is dangerous, but it is our only chance.
How long do you think we would last in this
open boat? In two or three days we would be
mad for food and drink, burning up under this
tropic sun.”</p>

<p>“Could we not land on one of the other
islands?”</p>

<p>“They are all populated, I take it, and our
end would be certain.”</p>

<p>“And what do you propose that I should do
while you are fighting for me on the ship?”</p>

<p>“You will stay in the boat which I shall make
fast to the ship, and if I should fail—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!”</p>

<p>“But I must say it. It is not beyond possibility
that I shall, although I do not think it, because
I believe God Who has preserved us hitherto
does not intend that we shall finally fail.
But if I should be overpowered or killed, there is
a plug in the bottom of the boat. All you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
to do is to cast off the painter and pull out the
plug and—drift away.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said. “And if anything
happens to you,” she looked at me directly as she
spoke, “I would rather drift away and drown—than
live without you.”</p>

<p>“Let us not dwell upon that,” said I. “Let us
hope that nothing will happen.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>“Now,” I continued, “I am going to ask you
a strange thing.”</p>

<p>She looked at me fearlessly and the trust and
confidence of her next words repaid all my
efforts a thousandfold.</p>

<p>“You can ask me anything you like,” she said
instantly.</p>

<p>“I am frightfully weary. I shall need what
strength I have for the work of the night. The
breeze is gentle and fair. There is no likelihood
that it will change. All you have to do is
to keep the boat on its course and awaken me if
anything should change. Will you try it and
help me thus far? I must have some sleep.”</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly,” was her brave and
direct reply, “and you can go to sleep with perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
confidence. I will watch over you and the
boat as best I can, God helping me. You know,
I slept most of the night, myself, and I feel in
no need of rest now.”</p>

<p>With my cutlass I broke open a cocoanut, the
milk and meat of which refreshed us both, and
then, as I was, I threw myself down on the bottom
of the boat, a hard bed, but one made soft by
great weariness and want of sleep. The last
thing I remember was the picture of Mistress
Wilberforce, beautiful in her disarray, sitting in
the stern sheets, holding the tiller in one hand
and the sheet in the other, looking down upon
me with a gaze I did not dare to think upon.
I had no idea how weary I was, for I was asleep
almost instantly, and it was five o’clock according
to my watch before she awakened me with a
touch of her little foot.</p>

<p>Although I was strained and stiff from the
cramped position and the hard planking on
which I lay, I knew that a stretch or two would
fix me and I was greatly refreshed by my sleep
and ready for a giant’s work.</p>

<p>“I had to wake you,” she said, reluctantly I
thought, “because the island is in sight, and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“The ship!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may see it dead ahead.”</p>

<p>Whereat I got to my knees and shaded my
eyes, for the sun had not yet set, and stared over
the water.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there lay <i>The Rose of Devon</i>.
She was still hull down in the shadow, but we
could see the masts, that is, what was left of
them. The mizzenmast was gone at the deck
and the main topmast at the hounds, but the foremast
still stood and the fore-topmast. The
mainyard was still across, as were the two yards
of the foremast. That was all I could make out
then.</p>

<p>The island merited no particular description,
for it was like hundreds of other South Seas
Pacific islands. It was low and hilly and surrounded
by a reef, but there was a broad opening
through the reef, at least we thought so because
the breakers suddenly ceased and there
was a long stretch of smooth black water before
they began again.</p>

<p>We had no time for many details, and indeed
I came instantly to action. The breeze had
practically died out and although the earthquake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
and tidal wave still caused a heavy sea, it was
gradually quieting down to long, gentle undulations.
I turned aft, unstepped the mast and
doused the sail, carefully placing both where they
might be of use in an emergency. Then I decided
to let the boat drift for a while, until it
grew dark enough to enable me to approach
the ship without danger of observation.</p>

<p>We made a good meal off the scanty provisions
we had left. My mistress was for saving
them, but I bluntly pointed out that either we
should have plenty in a few hours or be in no
need of anything to eat forever after, so we satisfied
our hunger and thirst abundantly, and then
as it wanted an hour or two of night, I made my
lady lie down, using the sail and my waistcoat
to soften the planking, and rest in her turn. She
obeyed me without question and, in spite of her
declaration that she was not tired, I had the
satisfaction of seeing in a few minutes that she
had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>I sat silently watching her through the hours
while the sun sank, while the dusk was followed
by darkness, until the stars came out and then I
stepped across her, seized the oars and started on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
my long pull toward the ship. We had drifted
southward I opined, but I had taken my bearings
carefully by the stars and I knew exactly in what
direction to send the dinghy. The noise of the
oars in the rowlocks finally awakened my lady.
She got to her feet, went aft, took the tiller and,
upon my giving her directions, steered a true
course for the ship.</p>

<p>I suppose it was close on to nine o’clock when
we reached her vicinity. I could not see my
watch. We had no means of making a light,
if we had dared upon the experiment. The
night was dark and moonless and, save for the
stars, as black as Egypt was fabled to be. The
waves rolling through the opening of the reef
and crashing on the shore drowned the noise of
the oars in the rowlocks. The tide was in full
flood, I judged, in fact just beginning to ebb, and
the breeze which had sprung up after sunset
was, as usual, offshore, two things greatly to
our advantage.</p>

<p>We did not see the ship until we were almost
upon her. Suddenly she loomed blackly out of
the darkness, like a smudge of soot of darker hue
than the rest. There was not a light upon her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
I rowed close to her, rounded her counter, and
discovered the Jacob’s ladder which usually hung
there still in place. I fastened the boat with a
turn of the painter around the ladder and belayed
it to a cleat aft, drew my sword from my
sheath, and then turned for a last word.</p>

<p>“You know what to do if I don’t come back?”
I whispered.</p>

<p>She nodded. I put out my hand and she took
it in both of hers. I was standing at the time and
she was sitting, and before I could stop her she
bent and kissed my great hand. I could not
trust myself any further. With a prayer, silent
but none the less fervent, I seized the rungs of
the Jacob’s ladder and slowly mounted to the
level of the rail abaft the trunk cabin which
served as a sort of poop deck. I had taken off
my shoes before I did so, and save for the creaking
caused by the swaying induced by my weight
on the ladder, I went up without a sound.</p>

<p>I swung my leg over the rail, after having
taken a quick look along the deck and having seen
nothing. Before I disappeared over the side I
turned and peered down through the blackness
at her upturned face. I could see dimly its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
whiteness. I waved my hand to her and she
waved hers in turn. She had the hardest part,
that of sitting still, not knowing whether success
was to attend our efforts or failure. The line
that was attached to the boat plug was in her
hand. The next few moments would determine
whether she would rejoin me on the ship or
whether she would cast off the painter, pull out
the plug, and drift away with the young ebb.</p>

<p>I had that picture in my mind’s eye, too, and
if I had needed anything to nerve me to the
service of my mistress it would have been that.
I had carried my cutlass in my teeth as I climbed
up the ladder. I instantly shifted it to my hand,
peering carefully about me as I made my way
along the top of the cabin. The deck was in a
frightful state of confusion. One of the deck
houses had been blown in by the storm and pieces
of wreckage lay all about. The starboard rail
had been shattered along the waist. They had
made little effort it seemed to clear up the raffle
and the wreckage.</p>

<p>I made my way forward slowly and with all
the softness of a great cat until I came to the
break of the cabin. Everything was in shadow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
and darkness, of course, yet I thought I detected
someone leaning against the starboard rail on
the quarter-deck abreast the mainmast, looking
toward the land. I stared and the longer I
stared the more convinced I became that someone
was there. I crossed over to the port side
and slipped down to the quarter-deck. Silently
as before, I made my way over the littered deck
in the direction of the standing figure.</p>

<p>If the deck had been clear, I could have
reached him without attracting his attention, but
within a few feet of him I stepped upon a round
marlinspike which slid under my feet and the
effort to recover my balance aroused the
watcher’s attention. He looked around suspiciously,
but the next moment I was upon him. I
did not know how many people were on that ship
and I could not afford to make any noise. If I
were to succeed I must deal with the enemy one
at a time. I caught this man by the throat with
one hand. The next instant I saw a flash of
something in the air and I was just in time to
seize his descending arm grasping his sheath
knife.</p>

<p>I held him in an iron grip. He kicked at me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
viciously but I lifted him higher into the air and
sank my fingers tighter and tighter in his throat.
Thereafter I held him there waiting. God
knows how I accomplished it, but I did. Presently
I felt him grow limp in my hands. I had
broken his wrist I discovered afterward, and had
nearly choked him to death. I laid him down
on the deck and with a piece of rope I lashed
him hand and foot. I didn’t know whether he
was dead or not but I couldn’t afford to take any
chances. I doubled another piece of rope and
thrust it tightly between his jaws which I pried
open, and so left him bound and gagged.</p>

<p>I thought I had worked silently, but either I
had made more noise than I fancied or else it
had come time for them to relieve the watch.
But for whatsoever cause it may be, as I was
bending over him, a ray of light suddenly shot
through the darkness. It came from the companion
hatchway which opened on the deck from
the low break of the trunk cabin, rising a few
feet above the quarter-deck. I sprang to my feet
and turned instantly, sword in hand, and the next
instant three figures broke out of the light. The
lantern they carried illuminated me completely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
If I had had more time I should have jumped
back into the shadows—I was quick-witted
enough to think of it—but the time was lacking.</p>

<p>The next moment the three precipitated themselves
upon me. They were half dressed, two of
them had sheath knives and the third a cutlass.
Fortunately none of them had brought a pistol.
They were courageous enough, I will say that
for them. And his daring brought the first man
who had the drawn sword to his fate, for as he
lunged at me I spitted him with my own cutlass.
I drove the blow home to the hilt. The
man went down like a ninepin, dragging the
sword from my hand, and as fortune would have
it he fell in front of number two, staggering him
so that he dropped the lantern, leaving the deck
in darkness save for the light which came from
the after cabin. Being otherwise weaponless, I
received number two with a mighty blow on
the jaw from my clenched fist which temporarily
accounted for him. Number three wavered indecisively
for a moment giving me time to draw
out my cutlass from the body of the dead man.
The blade was broken off about six inches from
the point, but nevertheless in a hand like mine it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
was a terrible weapon. I did not give him time
to recover, for I sprang upon him. He thrust
at me with his own knife half-heartedly, but in
a moment I struck it out of his hand and sent it
flying over the rail and into the sea.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, “get down on your knees and
beg for your life.”</p>

<p>There must have been something compelling
in my manner for he instantly obeyed me. He
threw himself flat before me and it was not until
I prodded him with my blade that he stopped
howling.</p>

<p>“Tell me quickly,” I said, “and tell me truly,
who are on the ship?”</p>

<p>“There were four of us,” he began.</p>

<p>“That is enough for the present,” I answered,
for I had accounted for the whole four. “Any
natives?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” I said.</p>

<p>I caught him by the collar of his shirt, dragged
him to his feet, marched him along the deck,
and bundled him to the forepeak. I drew the
hatch cover, battened it down and locked it. I
knew that he could not get out until I let him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
Then I walked back to the man I had struck
with my fist but discovered no signs of returning
consciousness in him. He was still helpless but
I lashed and gagged him as I had the first man.
Having made sure that I had nothing to fear
from these men I sprang to the rail on the top
of the trunk cabin.</p>

<p>“Mistress Lucy,” I cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God, thank God,” came her voice
in the darkness. “I heard the shouting, I saw the
light. Are you unharmed?”</p>

<p>“Entirely,” I answered, “and I have the ship.
Leave the boat fast as it is and climb aboard.
Stay, perhaps I would better descend and help
you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I can manage it myself.”</p>

<p>I leaned far over the rail and as soon as she
came within reach I caught her arm and presently
I had the satisfaction of lifting her up on
the top of the trunk cabin by my side.</p>

<p>“Safe now!” I cried triumphantly, resisting an
overwhelming temptation to take her in my arms
and shout for joy.</p>

<p>“What next?” she asked.</p>

<p>Singular how she asked me that question in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
every emergency. Well, I had, as I generally
had, an answer for her.</p>

<p>“I will get another lantern out of the cabin,”
I answered, “and then we shall see.”</p>

<p>To leap down the companion ladder and fetch
the lantern burning there was the work of a few
seconds. I had forgot the dead man whom I
had thrust through with my sword, but there he
lay in full view. My mistress screamed faintly.
I cursed myself for my forgetfulness. I had her
turn her back and without more ado I picked the
dead man up and hurled him overboard, praying
that God might have mercy on his soul, but
otherwise giving him little thought.</p>

<p>“Here are two men,” said I, flashing the lantern
over them, “they are still alive but bound
and helpless. I must get the ship under way
and I must depend upon you. If you will come
forward with me we will make shift to hoist the
jib or staysail, it is all we can do in this darkness.
We will cut the cable, and as the wind is offshore
and the tide beginning to ebb, we will get away
from these horrible islands.”</p>

<p>Hand in hand we ran rapidly forward. Fortunately,
the bowsprit still stood, even the flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
jib boom was in place. I overhauled the gear
and the two of us hoisted the jib, my lady pulling
on the halyards with me like a little man.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, “do you go aft and take the
wheel. Take the lantern with you. I will hold
out the jib sheet, cast her head to port, and tell
you in what direction to steer.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, fearful at leaving me.</p>

<p>“There is no danger,” I said. “There were
but four men on the ship, one is dead and overboard,
another locked up in the forepeak beneath
my feet, and two are as helpless as logs.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” said the girl resolutely, “although
it is frightfully dark.”</p>

<p>“The least call will bring me to your side,”
said I. “Take the lantern with you. I need it
not.”</p>

<p>I watched her walk rapidly along the deck,
lantern in hand. When she reached the wheel
I told her to cast off its lashings, put it amidships,
and then with an axe, which I had found lying
where they had left it after they had cut the
wreckage of the masts away, I severed the cable.
Thereafter I called aft to my lady to put the
helm hard astarboard. The bow of <i>The Rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
of Devon</i> slowly swung around, the sail filled
and presently I had the satisfaction of seeing her
slip through the entrance in the lagoon, past the
reef and into the open sea.</p>

<p>I belayed the jib sheet, ran aft and took the
helm. We were free. My mistress refused to
go below, refused to leave my side in fact, so
until daybreak we remained on deck, I steering,
she seated close by. And so we sped on through
the sweet summer night.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<span class="small">SHOWS HOW WE SAILED TO SAFETY AGAIN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;DO not suppose that a man and a woman
were ever confronted with a greater task
than that which we faced that morning. The
problem met me in so many ways that I was fairly
puzzled at it. The two men lying bound and
gagged on the deck had, of course, recovered
consciousness. The man below in the forepeak
had given some noisy signs of his presence.
These three had to be dealt with in some way.
The ship itself was wrecked, aloft that is, and I
had as yet no means of telling whether she were
tight below, although, as I deemed she sat about
as usual in the water, I concluded that if she had
sprung a leak they had succeeded in stopping it.</p>

<p>The dawn disclosed a white-faced man and
woman staring at each other near the wheel.
Breakfast was a problem in itself, too. On the
one hand, I did not like to send my lady below
without at least having made some sort of inspection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
myself, nor did I like to leave her alone on
deck, on the other.</p>

<p>“Of what are you thinking?” she asked presently,
seeing my brows knitted with the stress of
my mental effort.</p>

<p>“Breakfast, first of all, something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Let me go below and get it.”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I must see what’s below
first myself.”</p>

<p>“Very well then,” was her prompt, brave
answer. She rose as she spoke and seized the
spokes of the wheel. “I will steer the ship, only
do you hurry back.”</p>

<p>“If I only had a pistol to leave with you,” I
said.</p>

<p>“There is no danger,” she answered bravely
enough, “there were only four men on the ship
you said. One is dead, one is locked up forward,
and the other two—”</p>

<p>“I will make sure about them,” I interrupted,
going over and examining the lashings of the
two.</p>

<p>They were frightened to death and the man
with the broken wrist, although I didn’t know
it then, was suffering greatly. Their eyes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
mutely appealing, but I had no pity to waste.
Seeing that they were tightly bound and the
hatch forward securely battened, I turned and
ran below.</p>

<p>As fortune would have it a brace of pistols
lay on the table in the cabin. One of them was
loaded and primed and ready for use. It was
lucky for me that they had not used it last night,
I thought. I snatched it up, returned to the
deck, and laid it at my lady’s side. Thereafter I
felt much safer for I knew she could use it on
occasion. I then went below and resumed my
search. The cabin was frightfully untidy and
disorderly. Some of the mutineers at least had
made it their headquarters and the table was
covered with an accumulation of soiled dishes.
On a platter I found some cold salt beef and
bread and other things. There was no time to
be dainty, but I did make shift to clean a plate,
heaped it with hard bread and beef, drew a pannikin
of water, and returned to the deck with it.
We made our first breakfast by the wheel.</p>

<p>I had been thinking hard and I had come to
the conclusion that our only safety lay in keeping
the three members of the crew securely locked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
up. If I could have depended upon one of them
the problem would have been simplified immensely,
and if I could have depended upon two
we could have got along with some degree of
comfort, for the three of us with the aid of tackles
could have handled the ship while my lady
steered. But it was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>First I took the gags out of the mouths of the
two men, whereat he of the broken wrist told
me of his hurt. I cast off the lashings to verify
his statement. I had brought up from my cabin
and from Captain Matthews’ several sets of irons
for wrists and ankles. They had not disturbed
them although they had otherwise rummaged
and plundered the cabins and had destroyed
much in them wantonly. I clapped double irons
on the villain who was unhurt and irons on the
ankles of the man with the broken wrist. He
was in great pain and more or less helpless. I
fastened his feet to a ring bolt in the deck and
then took the other man and stowed him below
in my cabin which I carefully cleared of everything
and which I securely locked on the outside.
He was a small, slight man and I knew
that the door would hold him, but to make assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
doubly sure, I intended to put up a bar
when I had time.</p>

<p>Him of the broken wrist I put in the fourth
cabin which had not been occupied during the
cruise, as we had carried no second mate. Before
I turned the lock on him I set his wrist and
put it in splints as best I could. It was his right
wrist and little danger could be expected from
him. Nevertheless, I locked him up securely.
I saw that each room was provided with bread
and meat and water. I told them that I would
visit them once a day and give them food enough
for the day, and that if they attempted to break
out I would give them short shrift indeed.</p>

<p>Taking the pistol from my mistress, I then
went forward, opened the fore hatch and
descended into the forepeak. It was well I had
a weapon, for the man had possessed himself of
a cutlass and I have no doubt, if I had not presented
the pistol at him so soon as I put foot on
the ladder, he would have cut me down. I had
some trouble in getting him to put down his
weapon, he was so ugly and disobedient, and I
had about made up my mind to pull the trigger
and end it, as I had no time to waste on a murderer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
like that one. I guess he must have seen
in my face that my patience was at an end for
finally I had him in double irons as well. I left
him in the forecastle, first making a thorough
search for and removing everything that he
would be able to use as a weapon. A good many
of the seamen’s chests were there but they were
locked and I didn’t disturb them, as he had no
means of getting into them. I told him what I
had told the others. He was the biggest and
strongest man and he had the strongest prison.
The forepeak was separated from the rest of the
ship by a stout bulkhead and the only way he
could get out was by the hatch, which I drew
over until it was but six inches open and there
I secured it. The first part of the problem was
thus solved.</p>

<p>During all this, my mistress had stood bravely
by the helm. I shall never forget how beautiful
she looked, with the fresh breeze bringing color
into her pale cheeks and blowing back wisps of
her golden hair, lovely in its disarray. We were
both of us exactly as we had been when we came
out of the cave. I was about to go on further
business when she interrupted me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>“If you please,” she began with unusual
humility, “Master Hampdon, if you can spare
me a little while to myself now I should like to
go below. Perhaps the villains have left some
of my clothes intact and I may change my dress
and wash my face, and—”</p>

<p>“I am a brute not to have thought of it,” I
said. “Keep the pistol with you. Who knows
what may chance? I will take the wheel.
Come to me as soon as you may, for I shall be
anxious when you are out of my sight. When
I have finished on the deck I expect to make a
thorough investigation of the ship to see what
condition she is in and what is best to be done.”</p>

<p>“I shall hasten,” she said, turning away and
tripping lightly down the ladder.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time she was back transformed.
Although her cabin had been occupied
by some of the men and her things had been
overhauled and were in a state of confusion, yet
she had found suitable clothing and she presently
came up on deck looking as fresh and dainty as
if she had never been on an adventure in her life.
And yet, will you believe me? it was with a certain
very vivid regret I saw her put aside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
tunic I had made her, which had served her so
well.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, “that I ought to be doing
the same thing, but there will be time enough
for that later on. How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“Fit for anything.”</p>

<p>“And you will take the wheel?”</p>

<p>“Gladly.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said I, “you have nothing to do
but keep her before the wind.”</p>

<p>With that, axe in hand I went forward. I put
in the hardest hour or two of work in my life.
I never stopped a moment except to throw back
a word or two to my little mistress guiding the
ship. By the time I had finished, the decks of
<i>The Rose of Devon</i> presented an entirely different
appearance. I had chopped away and
thrown overboard the mast wreckage. When it
was too heavy, I clapped a tackle to it to assist
me. The tangled gear had been overhauled and
each brace, line, and halyard had been coiled
and hung to its proper pin. Although the ship
looked desolate and forlorn enough to a sailor,
and to anyone else perhaps, there was no confusion
or disorder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>By this time it was high noon. I knocked off
work therefore and, upon her insistence, relieved
her at the wheel while she went below to the
lazarette where the cabin stores were kept, to
prepare us something to eat. She said that was
her task, and although it irked me to see her
compelled to do anything, there was truth in her
words. I can do most things but cook. There,
I confess, I fail. I did kindle a fire for her in
the galley, however, and about one o’clock we
had a royal dinner, the first civilized meal, so
to speak, that we had enjoyed since the day of
the mutiny. She brought it up on deck and we
ate it together. After dinner she surprised me
by proffering me a pipe which she had found
below—it had been Captain Matthews’—and a
pouch of tobacco, and nothing would do but that
I must smoke before turning to again. I confess
that it tasted sweet to me, and felt sorry that
she could not enjoy the luxury, and told her so,
which seemed to give her great amusement.</p>

<p>Her light-heartedness cheered me immensely.
To be sure she did not quite imagine the extent
of the problem that lay before us, or perhaps she
knew more about it than I fancied, but whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
be the facts, I could not feel downhearted or
downcast when she smiled at me as she did then.</p>

<p>Well, the hour of refreshment and rest at last
came to an end. Surrendering the wheel to her,
I went forward. I had determined to loose the
mainsail first, if I could, and then loose the foresail
and topsail. The first was an easy enough
task. It took me some time to climb out on each
of the yardarms and cast off the gaskets, but
presently the huge sail hung in the buntlines. I
came down by the backstays, clapped a watch
tackle on each sheet and finally succeeded in getting
the sail set as taut as the bolt ropes would
allow. My mistress clapped her hands with joy
when I had succeeded. The slow pace of the
ship was much increased by the draw of the big
mainsail.</p>

<p>I did the same thing with the foresail and then
boldly tackled the fore-topsail, but here I met
with greater difficulties for the topsail yard—it
was a single topsail—had to be mastheaded
if the sail was to be of any use. Although I
clapped several tackles on it and pulled and
hauled lustily, it taxed my strength beyond its
limit. It was my mistress who came to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
assistance. She lashed the wheel amidships
while watching me pull at the halyards, and came
and seized the tarred rope with her own hands
and laid back with a will.</p>

<p>It was just the added pound or two that was
needed, and slowly, readjusting the tackles from
time to time, we at last mastheaded the fore-topsail
yard. I was glad that <i>The Rose of Devon</i>
was a small ship, for had that yard been a foot
longer or a pound heavier, we had never done it.
When I had finished I carefully braced the
yards, then I cast off the lashings of the wheel
and shifted it until the wind came from the starboard
quarter and lo and behold we were headed
due eastward!</p>

<p>The breeze was growing stronger but it was
still gentle. It blew fair and held steady. If it
would only blow long enough and hold without
change we would inevitably fetch the South
American coast, which I estimated something
more than fifteen hundred leagues away.</p>

<p>I rested a while but not for long. It was late
in the afternoon, yet I felt it necessary further to
overhaul the ship; so leaving my mistress again
in charge, a solitary woman on a half wrecked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
ship in a great waste of unknown seas!—I tell
you this that you may see how brave she was—I
went below, having first sounded the well and
found to my joy that there was no more than the
usual amount of water in it and that the ship
evidently was tight. She must have gone on the
sand in the storm in such a way as not to start a
leak, although it might be that a plank had been
started and that the men aboard her, one of
whom was an expert carpenter, had been able to
get at it and caulk it up. At any rate, she was
tight.</p>

<p>Everything below was in a state of disorder but
no especial damage had been done. I cleaned
out the cabin, washed the dishes and made everything
snug. In the cabin that Pimball had occupied
after my departure I found the famous
chart and the little image, both of which I put
carefully away. I was glad to see them again.
We have them still and often show them to our
children and friends as we tell again this tale.</p>

<p>I also estimated the provisions in the lazarette.
There was plenty of food for our immediate
needs, although most of the liquor was gone.
Then I went down into the hold. I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
enough supplies there to last the five of us who
were on board indefinitely. The arms chest had
been broken open and most of the arms were
gone—I suspected that they were back on the
Island of the Stairs! Those that remained I
carefully removed, and finding powder and shot,
I charged them and placed them under lock and
key in Captain Matthews’ cabin, which I had
reserved for my own use.</p>

<p>By the time I had finished, night had almost
fallen. I stopped before the doors where I had
confined the prisoners and asked them how they
did and if they wanted anything, being met with
oaths and curses from one man and cries of pain
from the other, to which I was alike indifferent.
I also visited the man in the forecastle and then
came back to take the wheel while my lady got
our supper.</p>

<p>I don’t think I was ever so tired in my life.
As I look back upon it it seems to me that I had
done ten men’s work. And yet there was nothing
but thankfulness in my heart as I hung over the
spokes and watched the ship rush toward safety
through the gently rolling seas. How mercifully
God had protected us. How He had used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
me to keep harm from this poor, helpless young
woman. I thanked Him for all His kindness
and prayed for a continuance of that favor until
we got safely home.</p>

<p>Supper was soon ready and it was a fine one.
My shipmate’s skill at cookery surprised me.
She had not stinted in her preparations, and the
best that the ship afforded, and I have told you
that she was expensively, even luxuriously,
stocked, was spread before me. How I did eat!
I am ashamed to think on it, even to this day.
After supper I had another pipe, and then plans
for the night had to be adjusted.</p>

<p>“Do you go below, Mistress Lucy,” I said,
“and turn in. I have my watch and I will
awaken you at midnight. You can then take the
wheel, and—”</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl, “I can’t think of going
below where those men are confined. It is
balmy out here. I shall sleep here on the deck
at your feet, within touch and call. I’d rather
have it so.”</p>

<p>I sought to change her decision but, as in all
matters which were not really vital, I was more
or less helpless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>“Well,” said I, “since you are resolved, take
the wheel and I will bring up your things to
make you comfortable.”</p>

<p>With that I descended to her cabin and
brought up a mattress, pillow, and blankets,
which I laid on the deck. The sea had gone
down and the ship was steady so my lady could
lie comfortably without being cast against anything,
but for precaution’s sake I put the mattress
against the foot of the trunk cabin in the angle
formed by the companionway. Before Mistress
Lucy went to sleep we had our evening prayers.
I had lighted the binnacle lamp in order to see
the compass course and she stood by it, reading a
psalm from her prayer book, which she had carried
ever with her, and so on until we said good-night.
She lay down at once and closed her eyes
and I thought she was asleep.</p>

<p>The steering of the ship was not very exhausting.
Under the diminished sail, which was all
that we could carry, she steered easily and the
wheel did not make many demands upon me. I
confess frankly that I never was so utterly weary
in my life. I had not had a regular sleep for
three days and I had worked to the extreme limit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
of my strength during all that time. I found
myself nodding over the wheel and finally I must
have gone sound asleep. The pressure of my
body as I leaned on the spokes brought the ship
around and it was the tremendous slatting of the
sails in the wind, which was ever freshening,
that awoke me.</p>

<p>The noise awoke my mistress too. She had
learned the sailor’s trick of waking with all her
faculties at her command, and this time she realized
the situation and came to her senses quicker
than I did.</p>

<p>“You were asleep,” she said, rising.</p>

<p>“Aye, that I was,” I answered shamefacedly,
bringing the ship before the wind again.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>When the sails began to draw once more, I
pulled out my watch and soon discovered that
it was only nine o’clock.</p>

<p>“I have had one hour’s sleep,” she said, “and
am able to take the watch now. I should not
have taken advantage of your offer before. You
have done enough in the past three days to have
killed half a dozen ordinary men. Now, do you
go to sleep and I will watch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>“You will wake me at midnight?” I asked.</p>

<p>She nodded. At this I put my watch into her
hand and started to go below.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “you must not leave me. Go
to sleep here on the deck where I can call you if
necessary.”</p>

<p>I tumbled down on the mattress I had fixed
for her and almost before I could draw the
blanket over me I was asleep. I say it to my
shame and her glory that she let me sleep the
long night through, for it was the sunlight that
awakened me, and when I opened my eyes, there
she stood, erect and dauntless, matchless, holding
the wheel.</p>

<span class="small">AND LOVE ROUNDS OUT THE TALE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is little more to tell. One day was
like another. For once that ocean which
I had always thought ill-called Pacific, did not
belie its name. The wind blew us steadily and
gently toward the haven we wished to reach. It
was hard work but we equally divided watches
and duties, I attending to all the trimming of
the yards, my mistress doing the cooking, and
after that first night we honorably kept watch
and watch at night. I do not know what would
have happened if it had come on to blow, for I
never could have reefed or furled those sails,
but the same Providence which had watched
over us kept us in recollection still. Indeed,
save for a certain nervous strain, I was never
better in my life, and my mistress also.</p>

<p>After many days’ sailing we approached the
South American coast and there were lucky
enough to fall in with a Spanish frigate. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
commander, Don Antonio Recaldé, came aboard
when he heard from the officer whom he had
sent off to us something of our story. He was
incredulous at first and not until we showed him
some of the jewels did he believe us. There was
a great risk, perhaps, in showing an ordinary
man such a valuable treasure, but we were both
agreed, my lady and I, that Don Antonio was to
be trusted absolutely.</p>

<p>Indeed, he proved himself a royal fellow in
that he took the three mutineers on his own ship
and sent a lieutenant and a dozen seamen aboard
<i>The Rose of Devon</i>, and as he was cruising on a
roving commission he convoyed us into Valparaiso.
The prisoners we turned over to the
English representative, to be tried for piracy and
murder. A trading ship bound through the
Straits of Magellan for Buenos Ayres offered
us an opportunity to return to the Atlantic. We
took advantage of this, disposing of <i>The Rose
of Devon</i> to a firm of Spanish merchants at Valparaiso
for a good price which provided us with
more than enough money for our return voyage,
and which relieved us of the necessity for offering
some of the jewels for sale which would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
involved explanations and possibly delay and
confiscation.</p>

<p>We did press upon Don Antonio an emerald
of great size and brilliancy which, generous seaman
that he was, he was loath to take but which
my mistress insisted upon, in addition to which
he received a certain percentage of the proceeds
of the sale of <i>The Rose of Devon</i> as salvage, so
that he and his men were well rewarded for their
kindness to us.</p>

<p>From Buenos Ayres, which we reached without
mishap, we took a coasting vessel, the only
one that served, for Rio de Janeiro, the capital
of the Portuguese possessions in the Brazils.
There we were lucky enough to find a large
Portuguese man-of-war frigate homeward bound
to Lisbon, whose captain obligingly received us
as passengers, being moved thereto, I more than
suspect, by the beauty of my lady. From Lisbon
by roundabout ways we finally landed in Plymouth
Harbor, whence we had set forth more
than a twelvemonth before. How good it was to
set foot on English ground once more! Yet I
was sadder that morning than I had been during
all our far voyaging. I hired a private coach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
and by nightfall we ended all our long journey at
Master Ficklin’s door. He, with that worthy
kindly woman his sister, greeted us as if we had
risen from the dead, and greatly rejoicing in my
lady’s good fortune, gave us the warmest of
welcomes.</p>

<p>That night I had what I expected would be
my last interview with her. We had been
thrown constantly together during the six months
that had elapsed since our great adventure on the
Island of the Stairs and our arrival in England.
We had discussed everything else, I think, but
I had said naught of my love. Indeed, each
league of sea over which we passed on our way
homeward seemed to remove her farther from
me. Although she was tender, she was considerate,
she was inviting, she was intimate, when
she was not arch, I could not bring myself to a
declaration.</p>

<p>We were alone. Good Mistress Ficklin had
given us her parlor for the evening. I took
from my pockets the canvas pouch filled with
her treasure which I had detached from my belt
as I had dressed that morning, and laid it on the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>“This, Mistress Wilberforce,” said I, formally
enough, although my heart was beating rapidly,
“is yours.”</p>

<p>She waved her hand as if it was of small
moment.</p>

<p>“We have discussed that before,” she said,
“what of yourself?”</p>

<p>“Last night,” I replied, “I went down to the
docks. A ship sails for the East Indies next
week. They want a chief mate and if my references
serve they will engage me.”</p>

<p>“And have you these references?”</p>

<p>“I thought, madam, that your friends in the
city might give them to me when they know.”</p>

<p>“But I have no friends in the city,” she answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“These,” said I, pointing to the table, “will
buy them for you.”</p>

<p>She stepped over to the table, untied the
strings and upon the velvet cloth fell the
sparkling gems.</p>

<p>“Would they not buy friends for you as well?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Mistress Lucy,” said I, “I want but one thing
in this world. No money, no jewels could buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
that, nor all the treasure we left behind upon that
island.”</p>

<p>“But if one should give you that,” she said
very softly, her eyes on the table and her white
hand lifting the stones and letting them fall.</p>

<p>“I am not worthy—to receive it,” said I.</p>

<p>“And so,” she said, without looking at me,
“and so it is good-by then. May you be happy.”</p>

<p>She extended her hand to me and I caught it
and kissed it passionately, but when I made to
let it go she would not.</p>

<p>“Master Hampdon,” she said, looking at me,
her eyes brighter than the diamonds and bluer
than the sapphires upon the table, “you are a
fool.”</p>

<p>“Right well I know that, Mistress,” said I,
striving to fetch a smile to match her own.</p>

<p>“And a blind man as well.”</p>

<p>Whereat I was a blind man, indeed, for my
eyes misted up, but not with blood as in the battle.
And I, as strong and tough as a mountain
ash, was as like to faint as any lovesick girl.</p>

<p>“John, John,” came the sweetest voice on earth
to me through the darkness, “don’t you see?
Don’t you know that I love you and you only,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
that you have all my heart and that my life,
which is yours a thousand times on sea and shore,
is not worth living without you?”</p>

<p>“But your friends, your world,” I protested as
she came nearer.</p>

<p>“I have no other friends, I want no other, and
you are my world.”</p>

<p>Well, it was not in me to resist after that, and
for the third time in my life I held her in my
arms, where since that hour she has often been
again, and for the third time I drank the sweetness
of her lips. She laughed presently and I
let her go a little, yet still held her close, and she
looked at me.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the night on <i>The Rose of
Devon</i> when first you kissed me?”</p>

<p>“If I should kiss you a million times, sweetheart,
as I mean to do,” I answered boldly, “I
should not forget a single one of them, much less
that.”</p>

<p>“And to punish you for your presumption,
although my heart went out to you I do confess,
I struck you; and to teach you to be a dutiful
husband, loving, devoted to me,” she paused and
laughed again, “I strike you once again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>Whereat she laid her hand once more, but in
tenderness, upon my cheek, following it with a
kiss. I have had his Majesty’s sword laid upon
my shoulder after I had led one of the King’s
ships to victory in the French wars, and I am
now, if you please, Sir John Hampdon. We
live at Wilberforce Castle and our children play
on the sward, but the royal accolade meant not
so much to me as that light blow upon my cheek
with which my dear mistress sealed our plighted
troth.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Note</i></p>

<p>I am often asked what became of the surviving
English on the island, and I can only answer
that I do not know. So far as I have learned,
no white man has ever visited that island since
that day, although the publication of these
memoirs may induce someone to go there for
the balance of the treasure, which is undoubtedly
still where we left it. They were resourceful
sailors, however, and I have no doubt if any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
them survived the earthquake, they managed to
get down the wall in some way, repaired their
canoes perhaps and returned to the island
whence they came, with the surviving natives,
and they and their descendants may be living
there, awaiting the arrival of some ship.</p>

<p>I heard also after some years, of the prisoners
we left in the hands of the British representative
at Valparaiso. One died, one escaped, and one
was hanged for the mutiny. Should anyone be
inspired by the recital of this story to seek the
Island of the Stairs—where what remains of the
treasure is theirs for the taking—and come upon
these mutineers, they may assure them that, so
far as my lady and I are concerned, no proceedings
will be instituted against them. The lapse
of years and the punishment their ringleaders
suffered have rendered any prosecution of them
impossible, and so far as we are concerned they
may return to England or go where they will
without molestation. God has undoubtedly
dealt with them, and we can leave their future to
Him.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
